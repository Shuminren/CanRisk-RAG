This study aimed to investigate the revolutionary deep learning methods to distinguish recalled but benign mammography images from negative exams and those with malignancy.
Experimental design: Deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) models were constructed to classify mammography images into malignant (breast cancer), negative (breast cancer free), and recalled-benign categories. A total of 14,860 images of 3,715 patients from two independent mammography datasets: Full-Field Digital Mammography Dataset (FFDM) and a digitized film dataset, Digital Dataset of Screening Mammography (DDSM), were used in various settings for training and testing the CNN models. The ROC curve was generated and the AUC was calculated as a metric of the classification accuracy.
Results: Training and testing using only the FFDM dataset resulted in AUC ranging from 0.70 to 0.81. When the DDSM dataset was used, AUC ranged from 0.77 to 0.96. When datasets were combined for training and testing, AUC ranged from 0.76 to 0.91. When pretrained on a large nonmedical dataset and DDSM, the models showed consistent improvements in AUC ranging from 0.02 to 0.05 (all P > 0.05), compared with pretraining only on the nonmedical dataset.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that automatic deep learning CNN methods can identify nuanced mammographic imaging features to distinguish recalled-benign images from malignant and negative cases, which may lead to a computerized clinical toolkit to help reduce false recalls."

Objective: To report the accuracy of risk assessment for breast cancer during a period of 19 years.
Design, setting, and participants: This cohort study of the Kaiser Permanente Washington breast imaging registry included women without previous breast cancer, aged 40 to 73 years, who attended screening from January 1, 1996, through December 31, 2013. Follow-up was completed on December 31, 2014, and data were analyzed from March 2, 2016, through November 13, 2017.
Exposures: Risk factors from a questionnaire and breast density from the Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System at entry; primary risk was assessed using the Tyrer-Cuzick model.
Main outcomes and measures: Incidence of invasive breast cancer was estimated with and without breast density. Follow-up began 6 months after the entry mammogram and extended to the earliest diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, censoring at 75 years of age, 2014, diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ, death, or health plan disenrollment. Observed divided by expected (O/E) numbers of cancer cases were compared using exact Poisson 95% CIs. Hazard ratios for the top decile of 10-year risk relative to the middle 80% of the study population were estimated. Constancy of relative risk calibration during follow-up was tested using a time-dependent proportional hazards effect.
Results: In this cohort study of 132 139 women (median age at entry, 50 years; interquartile range, 44-58 years), 2699 invasive breast cancers were subsequently diagnosed after a median 5.2 years of follow-up (interquartile range, 2.4-11.1 years; maximum follow-up, 19 years; annual incidence rate [IR] per 1000 women, 2.9). Observed number of cancer diagnoses was close to the expected number (O/E for the Tyrer-Cuzick model, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.98-1.06]; O/E for the Tyrer-Cuzick model with density, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.94-1.02]). The Tyrer-Cuzick model estimated 2554 women (1.9%) to be at high risk (10-year risk of 鈮8%), of whom 147 subsequently developed invasive breast cancer (O/E, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67-0.93; IR per 1000 women, 8.7). The Tyrer-Cuzick model with density estimated more women to be at high risk (4645 [3.5%]; 273 cancers [10.1%]; O/E, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.69-0.88; IR per 1000 women, 9.2). The hazard ratio for the highest risk decile compared with the middle 80% was 2.22 (95% CI, 2.02-2.45) for the Tyrer-Cuzick model and 2.55 (95% CI, 2.33-2.80) for the Tyrer-Cuzick model with density. Little evidence was found for a decrease in relative risk calibration throughout follow-up for the Tyrer-Cuzick model (age-adjusted slope, -0.003; 95% CI, -0.018 to 0.012) or the Tyrer-Cuzick model with density (age-adjusted slope, -0.008; 95% CI, -0.020 to 0.004).
Conclusions and relevance: Breast cancer risk assessment combining classic risk factors with mammographic density may provide useful data for 10 years or more and could be used to guide long-term, systematic, risk-adapted screening and prevention strategies."

Methods: A total of 4242 women between 40 and 69 years of age without a history of breast cancer were selected at primary healthcare facilities in Porto Alegre and submitted to mammographic screening. They were evaluated for potential risk factors.
Results: In all, 73 participants among the 4242 women had a breast cancer diagnosis during the follow-up of the project (10 years). The multivariate analysis considering all the patients aged 40-69 years showed that older age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.12), higher height (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.09), and history of previous breast biopsy (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.38-5.13) were associated with the development of breast cancer. Conversely, the number of pregnancies (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78-0.98) and use of hormone replacement therapy (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.20-0.75) were considered a protective factor. Additionally, we performed an analysis separating the participants into groups of 40-49 and 50-69 years old, since a risk factor could have a specific behavior in these age groups. No additional risk factors were identified within these age brackets, and some factors lost statistical significance.
Conclusion: The risk prediction model indicates that the following variables should be assessed in this specific population: age, height, having had previous breast biopsies, number of pregnancies, and use of hormone replacement therapy. These findings may help to better understand the causal model of breast cancer in Southern Brazil."

An image dataset including four view mammograms acquired from 1044 women was retrospectively assembled. All mammograms were originally interpreted as negative by radiologists. In the next subsequent mammography screening, 402 women were diagnosed with breast cancer and 642 remained negative. An existing CAD scheme was applied 'as is' to process each image. From CAD-generated results, four detection features including the total number of (1) initial detection seeds and (2) the final detected false-positive regions, (3) average and (4) sum of detection scores, were computed from each image. Then, by combining the features computed from two bilateral images of left and right breasts from either craniocaudal or mediolateral oblique view, two logistic regression models were trained and tested using a leave-one-case-out cross-validation method to predict the likelihood of each testing case being positive in the next subsequent screening. The new prediction model yielded the maximum prediction accuracy with an area under a ROC curve of AUC = 0.65 卤 0.017 and the maximum adjusted odds ratio of 4.49 with a 95% confidence interval of (2.95, 6.83). The results also showed an increasing trend in the adjusted odds ratio and risk prediction scores (p < 0.01). Thus, this study demonstrated that CAD-generated false-positives might include valuable information, which needs to be further explored for identifying and/or developing more effective imaging markers for predicting short-term breast cancer risk."

Yet a large proportion of CPMs are believed to be medically unnecessary. Thus, there is a pressing need to educate patients effectively on their CBC risk. We had earlier developed a CBC risk prediction model called CBCRisk based on eight personal risk factors.
Methods: In this study, we validate CBCRisk on independent clinical data from the Johns Hopkins University (JH) and MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDA). Women whose first breast cancer diagnosis was either invasive and/or ductal carcinoma in situ and whose age at first diagnosis was between 18 and 88 years were included in the cohorts because CBCRisk was developed specifically for these women. A woman who develops CBC is called a case whereas a woman who does not is called a control. The cohort sizes are 6035 (with 117 CBC cases) for JH and 5185 (with 111 CBC cases) for MDA. We computed the relevant calibration and validation measures for 3- and 5-year risk predictions.
Results: We found that the model performs reasonably well for both cohorts. In particular, area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for the two cohorts range from 0.61 to 0.65.
Conclusions: With this independent validation, CBCRisk can be used confidently in clinical settings for counseling BC patients by providing their individualized CBC risk. In turn, this may potentially help alleviate the rate of medically unnecessary CPMs."

Patients and methods: A set of 2138 examinations (1978 women) given a BI-RADS 4 with matching pathology results were analyzed. Predictors such as patient demographics, clinical risk factors, and imaging-derived features such as BI-RADS assessment and qualitative breast density were considered. Independent predictors of breast cancer were determined by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression.
Results: In univariate analysis, age, race, body mass index, age at first live birth, BI-RADS assessment, qualitative breast density, and risk triggers were found to be independent predictors. In multivariate analysis, age, BI-RADS score, breast density, race, presence of a lump, and number of risk triggers were the most predictive. An integrative logistic regression model achieved a performance of 0.84 cross-validated area under the curve. No variable was a constant independent predictor when stratifying the population on the basis of the BI-RADS score.
Conclusion: While BI-RADS assessment remains the strongest predictor of breast cancer, the inclusion of clinical risk factors such as age, breast density, presence of a lump, and number of risk triggers derived from guidelines improves the specificity of identifying individuals with imaging descriptors associated with BI-RADS 4A and 4B that are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer."

Methods: We conducted this case-control study in 2016 and enrolled 1422 women aged 30-75 years, including 506 women with breast cancer (cases) and 916 women without breast cancer (controls). We developed the BCS chart using a multiple logistic regression analysis. We combined the risks of breast cancer to predict the individual risk of breast cancer. Then, we stratified and colored the predicted risk probabilities as follows: <05% (green), 05-09% (yellow), 10-14% (orange), 15-19% (red), 20-24% (brown) and 鈮25% (black).
Results: The BCS chart provides the risk probability of breast cancer, based on age, body mass index, late menopause, having a benign breast disease and a positive family history of breast cancer among the first-degree or the second/third-degree relatives. According to this chart, an individual can be classified in a category of low risk (green), medium risk (yellow and orange), high risk (red and brown) and very high risk (black) for breast cancer.

Objective: To determine whether a panel of 18 SNPs (SNP18) may be used to predict breast cancer in combination with classic risk factors and mammographic density.
Design, setting, and participants: This cohort study enrolled a subcohort of 9363 women, aged 46 to 73 years, without a previous breast cancer diagnosis from the larger prospective cohort of the PROCAS study (Predicting Risk of Cancer at Screening) specifically to evaluate breast cancer risk-assessment methods. Enrollment took place from October 2009 through June 2015 from multiple population-based screening centers in Greater Manchester, England. Follow-up continued through January 5, 2017.
Exposures: Genotyping of 18 SNPs, visual-assessment percentage mammographic density, and classic risk assessed by the Tyrer-Cuzick risk model from a self-completed questionnaire at cohort entry.
Main outcomes and measures: The predictive ability of SNP18 for breast cancer diagnosis (invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ) was assessed using logistic regression odds ratios per interquartile range of the predicted risk.
Results: A total of 9363 women were enrolled in this study (mean [range] age, 59 [46-73] years). Of these, 466 were found to have breast cancer (271 prevalent; 195 incident). SNP18 was similarly predictive when unadjusted or adjusted for mammographic density and classic factors (odds ratios per interquartile range, respectively, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.38-1.77 and 1.53; 95% CI, 1.35-1.74), with observed risks being very close to expected (adjusted observed-to-expected odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.69-1.28). A combined risk assessment indicated 18% of the subcohort to be at 5% or greater 10-year risk, compared with 30% of all cancers, 35% of interval-detected cancers, and 42% of stage 2+ cancers. In contrast, 33% of the subcohort were at less than 2% risk but accounted for only 18%, 17%, and 15% of the total, interval, and stage 2+ breast cancers, respectively.
Conclusions and relevance: SNP18 added substantial information to risk assessment based on the Tyrer-Cuzick model and mammographic density. A combined risk is likely to aid risk-stratified screening and prevention strategies."

The GRS92, modifiable and non-modifiable risk factor scores were estimated via logistic regression. SNPs without available genotyping were simulated as in the aforementioned 2016 study. The full model score was obtained by combining GRS92, modifiable and non-modifiable risk factor scores. Score performances were tested via the area under the ROC curve (AUROC), net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Compared with non-modifiable and modifiable factor scores, GRS92 had higher discrimination power (AUROC: 0.6195, 0.5885 and 0.5214, respectively). Adding the non-modifiable factor score to GRS92 improved patient classification by 23.6% (NRI = 0.236), while the modifiable factor score only improved it by 7.2%. The full model AUROC reached 0.6244. A simulation study showed the ability of the full model for identifying women at high risk for breast cancer.

Although most of the well-known models were designed based on data collected from western population, yet they have been utilized for surveillance purposes in many limited-resource countries. Given the genetic variations in risk factors that exist between different races, we therefore aimed to develop and validate a tool for breast cancer risk assessment among Sudanese women.
Methods: Using cross-sectional design, 153 subjects were eligible to participate in our study. Data were collected from the only couple of tertiary centers in Sudan. They underwent multiple logistic regression using purposeful selection method to build the model. Various adjustments were made to determine significant predictors. Overall performance, calibration and discrimination were assessed by R 2, O/E ratio and c-statistic, respectively.
Results: SUDAN predictors of breast cancer were: age, menarche, family history, vegetables and fruits weekly servings, and type of cereals that traditional cuisine is made of. Both Nagelkerke R 2 (0.495) and O/E ratio (0.78) were good. c-statistic expressed the excellent discriminatory power of the model (0.864, p < 0.001, 95% CI 0.81-0.92).
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that SUDAN provides a simple, efficient and well-calibrated tool to predict and classify women's lifetime risks of developing breast cancer. Input from our model could be deployed to guide utilization of the more advanced screening modalities in resource-limited settings to maximize cost effectiveness. Consequently, this might improve the stage at which the diagnosis is usually made."

The screening phases required for studies of this type are often prolonged, since the process of determining the molecular subtype and carrying out additional biomarker assessment is time-consuming. Parameters such as germline genotypes capable of predicting the molecular subtype before it becomes available from pathology might be helpful for treatment planning and optimizing the timing and cost of screening phases. This appears to be feasible, as rapid and low-cost genotyping methods are becoming increasingly available. The aim of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for breast cancer risk capable of predicting triple negativity, in addition to clinical predictors, in breast cancer patients.
Methods: This cross-sectional observational study included 1271 women with invasive breast cancer who were treated at a university hospital. A total of 76 validated breast cancer risk SNPs were successfully genotyped. Univariate associations between each SNP and triple negativity were explored using logistic regression analyses. Several variable selection and regression techniques were applied to identify a set of SNPs that together improve the prediction of triple negativity in addition to the clinical predictors of age at diagnosis and body mass index (BMI). The most accurate prediction method was determined by cross-validation.
Results: The SNP rs10069690 (TERT, CLPTM1L) was the only significant SNP (corrected p = 0.02) after correction of p values for multiple testing in the univariate analyses. This SNP and three additional SNPs from the genes RAD51B, CCND1, and FGFR2 were selected for prediction of triple negativity. The addition of these SNPs to clinical predictors increased the cross-validated area under the curve (AUC) from 0.618 to 0.625. Age at diagnosis was the strongest predictor, stronger than any genetic characteristics.
Conclusion: Prediction of triple-negative breast cancer can be improved if SNPs associated with breast cancer risk are added to a prediction rule based on age at diagnosis and BMI. This finding could be used for prescreening purposes in complex molecular therapy studies for triple-negative breast cancer."

Circulating microRNAs (C-miRNAs) have emerged as measurable biomarkers (liquid biopsies) for cancer detection. We evaluated the ability of C-miRNAs to identify women most likely to develop breast cancer by profiling miRNA from serum obtained long before diagnosis. 24 breast cancer cases and controls (matched for risk and age) were identified from women enrolled in the High-Risk Breast Program at the UVM Cancer Center. Isolated RNA from serum was profiled for over 2500 human miRNAs. The miRNA expression data were input into a stepwise linear regression model to discover a multivariable miRNA signature that predicts long-term risk of breast cancer. 25 candidate miRNAs were identified that individually classified cases and controls based on statistical methodologies. A refined 6-miRNA risk-signature was discovered following regression modeling that distinguishes cases and controls (AUC0.896, CI 0.804-0.988) in this cohort. A functional relationship between miRNAs that cluster together when cases are contrasted against controls was suggested and confirmed by pathway analyses. The discovered 6 miRNA risk-signature can discriminate high-risk women who ultimately develop breast cancer from those who remain cancer-free, improving current risk assessment models. Future studies will focus on functional analysis of the miRNAs in this signature and testing in larger cohorts. We propose that the combined signature is highly significant for predicting cancer risk, and worthy of further screening in larger, independent clinical cohorts."

To efficiently screen for breast cancer, the individual risk of the disease should be determined. We describe a model that could be used at most mammography screening units without adding substantial cost.
Methods: The study was based on the Karma cohort, which included 70,877 participants. Mammograms were collected up to 3 years following the baseline mammogram. A prediction protocol was developed using mammographic density, computer-aided detection of microcalcifications and masses, use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), family history of breast cancer, menopausal status, age, and body mass index. Relative risks were calculated using conditional logistic regression. Absolute risks were calculated using the iCARE protocol.
Results: Comparing women at highest and lowest mammographic density yielded a fivefold higher risk of breast cancer for women at highest density. When adding microcalcifications and masses to the model, high-risk women had a nearly ninefold higher risk of breast cancer than those at lowest risk. In the full model, taking HRT use, family history of breast cancer, and menopausal status into consideration, the AUC reached 0.71.
Conclusions: Measures of mammographic features and information on HRT use, family history of breast cancer, and menopausal status enabled early identification of women within the mammography screening program at such a high risk of breast cancer that additional examinations are warranted. In contrast, women at low risk could probably be screened less intensively."

This is a particularly disturbing trend as a large proportion of these CPMs are believed to be medically unnecessary. Many BC patients tend to substantially overestimate their CBC risk. Thus, there is a pressing need to educate patients effectively on their CBC risk. We develop a CBC risk prediction model to aid physicians in this task.
Methods: We used data from two sources: Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results to build the model. The model building steps are similar to those used in developing the BC risk assessment tool (popularly known as Gail model) for counseling women on their BC risk. Our model, named CBCRisk, is exclusively designed for counseling women diagnosed with unilateral BC on the risk of developing CBC.
Results: We identified eight factors to be significantly associated with CBC-age at first BC diagnosis, anti-estrogen therapy, family history of BC, high-risk pre-neoplasia status, estrogen receptor status, breast density, type of first BC, and age at first birth. Combining the relative risk estimates with the relevant hazard rates, CBCRisk projects absolute risk of developing CBC over a given period.
Conclusions: By providing individualized CBC risk estimates, CBCRisk may help in counseling of BC patients. In turn, this may potentially help alleviate the rate of medically unnecessary CPMs."

We investigated the association between three different methods of measuring density or parenchymal pattern/texture on digitized film-based mammograms, and examined to what extent textural features independently and jointly with density can improve the ability to identify screening women at increased risk of breast cancer.
Methods: The study included 121 cases and 259 age- and time matched controls based on a cohort of 14,736 women with negative screening mammograms from a population-based screening programme in Denmark in 2007 (followed until 31 December 2010). Mammograms were assessed using the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density classification, Tab谩r's classification on parenchymal patterns and a fully automated texture quantification technique. The individual and combined association with breast cancer was estimated using binary logistic regression to calculate Odds Ratios (ORs) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs).
Results: Cases showed significantly higher BI-RADS and texture scores on average than controls (p < 0.001). All three methods were individually able to segregate women into different risk groups showing significant ORs for BI-RADS D3 and D4 (OR: 2.37; 1.32-4.25 and 3.93; 1.88-8.20), Tab谩r's PIII and PIV (OR: 3.23; 1.20-8.75 and 4.40; 2.31-8.38), and the highest quartile of the texture score (3.04; 1.63-5.67).

Combining two or more methods increased model fit in all combinations, demonstrating the highest AUC of 0.69 (0.63-0.74) when all three methods were combined (a significant increase from standard BI-RADS alone).
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the (relative) amount of fibroglandular tissue (density) and mammographic structural features (texture/parenchymal pattern) jointly can improve risk segregation of screening women, using information already available from normal screening routine, in respect to future personalized screening strategies."

Methods: We evaluated 88 breast cancer risk variants that were identified previously by GWAS in 11,760 cases and 11,612 controls of Asian ancestry. SNPs confirmed to be associated with breast cancer risk in Asian women were used to construct a polygenic risk score (PRS). The relative and absolute risks of breast cancer by the PRS percentiles were estimated based on the PRS distribution, and were used to stratify women into different levels of breast cancer risk.
Results: We confirmed significant associations with breast cancer risk for SNPs in 44 of the 78 previously reported loci at P < 0.05. Compared with women in the middle quintile of the PRS, women in the top 1% group had a 2.70-fold elevated risk of breast cancer (95% CI: 2.15-3.40).

Methods: We used Nurses' Health Study (NHS) data beginning in 2004 and Women's Health Initiative (WHI) data beginning in 2005 to compare BCRAT's performance among women age 75 years and older with that in women age 55 to 74 years in predicting five-year breast cancer incidence. BCRAT risk factors include: age, race/ethnicity, age at menarche, age at first birth, family history, history of benign breast biopsy, and atypia. We examined BCRAT's calibration by age by comparing expected/observed (E/O) ratios of breast cancer incidence. We examined discrimination by computing c-statistics for the model by age.

The utility of using relative and absolute area-based breast density-related measures was evaluated as an alternative to clinical risk factors in cancer risk assessment at the time of screening mammography.
Methods: Contralateral mediolateral oblique digital mammography images from 392 females with unilateral breast cancer and 817 age-matched controls were analysed. Information on clinical risk factors was obtained from the provincial breast-imaging information system. Breast density-related measures were assessed using a fully automated breast density measurement software. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was used to evaluate the performance of three cancer risk models: the first using only clinical risk factors, the second using only density-related measures and the third using both clinical risk factors and density-related measures.
Results: The risk factor-based model generated an AUROC of 0.535, while the model including only breast density-related measures generated a significantly higher AUROC of 0.622 (p < 0.001). The third combined model generated an AUROC of 0.632 and performed significantly better than the risk factor model (p < 0.001) but not the density-related measures model (p = 0.097).
Conclusion: Density-related measures from screening mammograms at the time of screen may be superior predictors of cancer compared with clinical risk factors.
Advances in knowledge: Breast cancer risk models based on density-related measures alone can outperform risk models based on clinical factors. Such models may support the development of personalized breast-screening protocols."

For each woman, the first ""prior"" examination in the series was interpreted as negative (not recalled) during the original image reading. In the second ""current"" examination, 430 women were diagnosed with pathology verified cancers and 440 remained negative (""cancer-free""). For each of four bilateral craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique view images of left and right breasts, we computed and analyzed eight groups of global mammographic texture and tissue density image features. A risk prediction model based on three artificial neural networks was developed to fuse image features computed from two bilateral views of four images. The risk model performance was tested using a ten-fold cross-validation method and a number of performance evaluation indices including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and odds ratio (OR). The highest AUC = 0.725 卤 0.026 was obtained when the model was trained by gray-level run length statistics texture features computed on dense breast regions, which was significantly higher than the AUC values achieved using the model trained by only two bilateral one-view images (p < 0.02).

We present a risk prediction model that incorporates histologic features of biopsy tissues from women with benign breast disease (BBD) and compare its performance to the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT).
Methods: We estimated the age-specific incidence of breast cancer and death from the Mayo BBD cohort and then combined these estimates with a relative risk model derived from 377 patient cases with breast cancer and 734 matched controls sampled from the Mayo BBD cohort to develop the BBD-to-breast cancer (BBD-BC) risk assessment tool. We validated the model using an independent set of 378 patient cases with breast cancer and 728 matched controls from the Mayo BBD cohort and compared the risk predictions from our model with those from the BCRAT.
Results: The BBD-BC model predicts the probability of breast cancer in women with BBD using tissue-based and other risk factors. The concordance statistic from the BBD-BC model was 0.665 in the model development series and 0.629 in the validation series; these values were higher than those from the BCRAT (0.567 and 0.472, respectively). The BCRAT significantly underpredicted breast cancer risk after benign biopsy (P = .004), whereas the BBD-BC predictions were appropriately calibrated to observed cancers (P = .247).
Conclusion: We developed a model using both demographic and histologic features to predict breast cancer risk in women with BBD. Our model more accurately classifies a woman's breast cancer risk after a benign biopsy than the BCRAT."

Methods: We examined subtypes in 629 women with invasive BC, diagnosed from 2006 to 2012, and enrolled in an epidemiological study in New Jersey. Using molecular characteristics from pathology reports, BCs were categorized as luminal A, luminal B, non-luminal HER2-expressing, or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. Multinomial logistic models (luminal A as referent) were used to describe BC subtype associations.
Results: Women with luminal B tumors were more likely to be younger at diagnosis [odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-3.4] and to have higher-grade (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.5-4.7), larger (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.6), and Ki67-positive tumors (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.0). Women with non-luminal HER2-expressing BCs were more likely to have higher-grade tumors (OR 14.5, 95% CI 5.3-39.7). Women with TNBCs were more likely to be African-American (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.4) and to have higher-grade (OR 9.7, 95% CI 5.1-18.4), larger (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-4.8), and Ki67-positive (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.6-5.2) tumors. Notably, compared to the luminal A subtype, luminal B, non-luminal HER2-expressing, and triple-negative subtypes were more frequently self-detected; however, these associations were attenuated in multivariable models.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that some BC subtypes were associated with features denoting more aggressive phenotypes, namely higher grade, larger size, and Ki67 positivity, and possibly patient self-detection among some women.

Methods: We developed an age-period-cohort model of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive breast cancer incidence in U.S. females using cancer registry data. Five functions were included in the model to estimate stage-specific effects for age, premenopausal birth cohorts, postmenopausal birth cohorts, period (for all years of diagnosis), and a mammography period effect limited to women ages 鈮 40 years after 1982. Incidence with and without the mammography period effect was calculated.
Results: More recent birth cohorts have elevated underlying risk compared with earlier cohorts for both pre- and postmenopausal women. Comparing models with and without the mammography period effect showed that overall breast cancer incidence would have been 23.1% lower in the absence of mammography in 2010 (95% confidence intervals, 18.8-27.4), including 14.7% (9.5-19.3) lower for invasive breast cancer and 54.5% (47.4-59.6) lower for DCIS. Incidence of distant-staged breast cancer in 2010 would have been 29.0% (13.1-48.1) greater in the absence of mammography screening.
Conclusions: Mammography contributes to markedly elevated rates of DCIS and early-stage invasive cancers, but also contributes to substantial reductions in the incidence of metastatic breast cancer.
Impact: Mammography is an important tool for reducing the burden of breast cancer, but future work is needed to identify risk factors accounting for increasing underlying incidence and to distinguish between indolent and potentially lethal early-stage breast cancers that are detected via mammography."

Here, we describe a DNA-microarray-based transcriptional model for breast cancer risk prediction for patients with sclerosing adenosis (SA), which represent 录 of all BBD patients. A training set was developed from 86 patients diagnosed with SA, of which 27 subsequently developed cancer within 10 years (cases) and 59 remained cancer-free at 10 years (controls). An diagonal linear discriminate analysis-prediction model for prediction of cancer within 10 years (SA TTC10) was generated from transcriptional profiles of FFPE biopsy-derived RNA. This model was tested on a separate validation case-control set composed of 65 SA patients. The SA TTC10 gene signature model, composed of 35 gene features, achieved a clear and significant separation between case and control with receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.913 in the training set and 0.836 in the validation set. Our results provide the first demonstration that benign breast tissue contains transcriptional alterations that indicate risk of breast cancer development, demonstrating that essential precursor biomarkers of malignancy are present many years prior to cancer development. Furthermore, the SA TTC10 gene signature model, which can be assessed on FFPE biopsies, constitutes a novel prognostic biomarker for patients with SA."

Using the subsequent 5 years of follow-up data, we evaluated calibration as the ratio of expected to observed number of breast cancers and assessed discriminatory accuracy using the concordance statistic.

In this paper we develop a model to adjust mammographic density for age and BMI and show how this adjusted mammographic density measure might be used with existing risk prediction models to identify high-risk women more precisely.
Methods: We explored the association between age, BMI, visually assessed percent dense area and breast cancer risk in a nested case-control study of women from the placebo arm of the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study I (72 cases, 486 controls). Linear regression was used to adjust mammographic density for age and BMI. This adjusted measure was evaluated in a multivariable logistic regression model that included the Tyrer-Cuzick (TC) risk score, which is based on classical breast cancer risk factors.
Results: Percent dense area adjusted for age and BMI (the density residual) was a stronger measure of breast cancer risk than unadjusted percent dense area (odds ratio per standard deviation 1.55 versus 1.38; area under the curve (AUC) 0.62 versus 0.59). Furthermore, in this population at increased risk of breast cancer, the density residual added information beyond that obtained from the TC model alone, with the AUC for the model containing both TC risk and density residual being 0.62 compared to 0.51 for the model containing TC risk alone (P =0.002).
Conclusions: In women at high risk of breast cancer, adjusting percent mammographic density for age and BMI provides additional predictive information to the TC risk score, which already incorporates BMI, age, family history and other classic breast cancer risk factors. Furthermore, simple selection criteria can be developed using mammographic density, age and BMI to identify women at increased risk in a clinical setting.

Therefore, we evaluated whether inclusion of plasma estradiol, estrone, estrone sulfate, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, prolactin, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) improved risk prediction for postmenopausal invasive breast cancer (n = 437 patient cases and n = 775 controls not using postmenopausal hormones) in the Nurses' Health Study.
Methods: We evaluated improvement in the area under the curve (AUC) for 5-year risk of invasive breast cancer by adding each hormone to the Gail and Rosner-Colditz risk scores. We used stepwise regression to identify the subset of hormones most associated with risk and assessed AUC improvement; we used 10-fold cross validation to assess model overfitting.
Results: Each hormone was associated with breast cancer risk (odds ratio doubling, 0.82 [SHBG] to 1.37 [estrone sulfate]). Individual hormones improved the AUC by 1.3 to 5.2 units relative to the Gail score and 0.3 to 2.9 for the Rosner-Colditz score. Estrone sulfate, testosterone, and prolactin were selected by stepwise regression and increased the AUC by 5.9 units (P = .003) for the Gail score and 3.4 (P = .04) for the Rosner-Colditz score. In cross validation, the average AUC change across the validation data sets was 6.0 (P = .002) and 3.0 units (P = .03), respectively. Similar results were observed for estrogen receptor-positive disease (selected hormones: estrone sulfate, testosterone, prolactin, and SHBG; change in AUC, 8.8 [P < .001] for Gail score and 5.8 [P = .004] for Rosner-Colditz score).

A risk assessment tool may be useful for selection of high-risk subsets of population for mammography screening in low-incidence and resource-limited developing country. The odd ratios for six main risk factors of breast cancer were pooled by review manager after a systematic research of literature. Health risk appraisal (HRA) model was developed to predict an individual's risk of developing breast cancer in the next 5 years from current age. The performance of this HRA model was assessed based on a first-round screening database. Estimated risk of breast cancer increased with age. Increases in the 5-year risk of developing breast cancer were found with the existence of any of included risk factors. When individuals who had risk above median risk (3.3鈥) were selected from the validation database, the sensitivity is 60.0% and the specificity is 47.8%. The unweighted area under the curve (AUC) was 0.64 (95% CI = 0.50-0.78). The risk-prediction model reported in this article is based on a combination of risk factors and shows good overall predictive power, but it is still weak at predicting which particular women will develop the disease. It would be very helpful for the improvement of a current model if more population-based prospective follow-up studies were used for the validation."

A risk assessment model incorporating both validated genetic variants and established risk factors may improve its performance in risk prediction of Asian women.
Methods: A nested case-control study of female breast cancer (411 cases and 1,212 controls) within the Singapore Chinese Health Study was conducted to investigate the effects of 51 genetic variants identified in previous GWAS on breast cancer risk. The independent effect of these genetic variants was assessed by creating a summed genetic risk score (GRS) after adjustment for body mass index and the Gail model risk factors for breast cancer.
Results: The GRS was an independent predictor of breast cancer risk in Chinese women. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of breast cancer for the second, third, and fourth quartiles of the GRS were 1.26 (0.90 to 1.76), 1.47 (1.06 to 2.04) and 1.75 (1.27 to 2.41) respectively (P for trend<0.001). In addition to established risk factors, the GRS improved the classification of 6.2% of women for their absolute risk of breast cancer in the next five years.
Conclusions: Genetic variants on top of conventional risk factors can improve the risk prediction of breast cancer in Chinese women."

Methods: A polyfactorial risk model (PFRM) was built from both clinical data and functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) gene candidates using multivariate logistic regression analysis on data from 5022 US Caucasian females (1671 breast cancer cases, 3351 controls), validated in an independent set of 1193 women (400 cases, 793 controls), and reassessed in a unique high incidence breast cancer population (165 cases, 173 controls) from Marin County, CA.
Results: The optimized PFRM consisted of 22 SNPs (19 genes, 6 regulating steroid metabolism) and 5 clinical risk factors, and its 5-year and lifetime risk prediction performance proved significantly superior (~ 2-fold) over the Gail model (Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, BCRAT), whether assessed by odds (OR) or positive likelihood (PLR) ratios over increasing model risk levels. Improved performance of the PFRM in high risk Marin women was due in part to genotype enrichment by a CYP11B2 (-344T/C) variant.
Conclusions and general significance: Since the optimized PFRM consistently outperformed BCRAT in all Caucasian study populations, it represents an improved personalized risk assessment tool.

They should be useful in identifying high risk women for screening in limited-resource countries. However, previous models showed poor performance in derived and validated settings. Therefore, we aimed to develop and validate a breast cancer risk prediction model for Thai women.
Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study consisted of derived and validation phases. Data collected at Ramathibodi and other two hospitals were used for deriving and externally validating models, respectively. Multiple logistic regression was applied to construct the model. Calibration and discrimination performances were assessed using the observed/expected ratio and concordance statistic (C-statistic), respectively. A bootstrap with 200 repetitions was applied for internal validation.
Results: Age, menopausal status, body mass index, and use of oral contraceptives were significantly associated with breast cancer and were included in the model. Observed/expected ratio and C-statistic were 1.00 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.21) and 0.651 (95% CI: 0.595, 0.707), respectively. Internal validation showed good performance with a bias of 0.010 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.018) and C-statistic of 0.646(95% CI: 0.642, 0.650). The observed/expected ratio and C-statistic from external validation were 0.97 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.35) and 0.609 (95% CI: 0.511, 0.706), respectively. Risk scores were created and was stratified as low (0-0.86), low-intermediate (0.87-1.14), intermediate-high (1.15-1.52), and high-risk (1.53-3.40) groups.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 352 positive screening mammograms of women participating in the Dutch screening programme (Nijmegen region, 2006-2008). The following mammographic findings were assessed by consensus reading of three expert radiologists: masses and mass density, calcifications, architectural distortion, focal asymmetry and mammographic density, and BI-RADS. Data on age, diagnostic workup and final diagnosis were collected from patient records. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to build a breast cancer prediction model, presented as a nomogram.
Results: Breast cancer was diagnosed in 108 cases (31 %). The highest positive predictive value (PPV) was found for spiculated masses (96 %) and the lowest for well-defined masses (10 %). Characteristics included in the nomogram are age, mass, calcifications, architectural distortion and focal asymmetry.
Conclusion: With our nomogram we developed a tool assisting screening radiologists in determining the chance of malignancy based on mammographic findings. We propose cutoff values for assigning BI-RADS in the Dutch programme based on our nomogram, which will need to be validated in future research. These values can easily be adapted for use in other screening programmes.
Key points: 鈥 There is substantial reader variability in assigning BI-RADS in mammographic screening. 鈥 There are no strict guidelines linking mammographic findings to BI-RADS categories. 鈥 We developed a model (nomogram) predicting the presence of breast cancer. 鈥 Our nomogram is based on common findings on positive screening mammograms. 鈥 The nomogram aims to assist screening radiologists in assigning BI-RADS categories."

We conducted a population-based study to estimate the independent effect of breast density on breast cancer risk and to evaluate the potential of breast density as a marker of risk in an intermediate risk population. From November 2006 to April 2009, data that included American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density categories and risk information were collected on 52,752 women aged 50-69 years without previously diagnosed breast cancer who underwent screening mammography examination. A total of 257 screen-detected breast cancers were identified. Logistic regression was used to assess the effect of breast density on breast carcinoma risk and to control for other risk factors. The risk increased with density and the odds ratio for breast cancer among women with dense breast (heterogeneously and extremely dense breast), was 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.8) compared with women with almost entirely fat breasts, after adjustment for age, body mass index, age at menarche, age at menopause, age at first childbirth, number of live births, use of oral contraceptive, family history of breast cancer, prior breast procedures, and hormone replacement therapy use that were all significantly related to breast density (p < 0.001). In multivariate model, breast cancer risk increased with age, body mass index, family history of breast cancer, prior breast procedure and breast density and decreased with number of live births.

It is based on a statistical learning model that combines computerized image features related to bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry and other clinical factors.
Materials and methods: A database of negative digital mammograms acquired from 994 women was retrospectively collected. In the next sequential screening examination (12 to 36 months later), 283 women were diagnosed positive for cancer, 349 were recalled for additional diagnostic workups and later proved to be benign, and 362 remain negative (not recalled). From an initial pool of 183 features, we applied a Sequential Forward Floating Selection feature selection method to search for effective features. Using 10 selected features, we developed and trained a support vector machine classification model to compute a cancer risk or probability score for each case. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and odds ratios (ORs) were used as the two performance assessment indices.
Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.725 卤 0.018 was obtained for positive and negative/benign case classification. The ORs showed an increasing risk trend with increasing model-generated risk scores (from 1.00 to 12.34, between positive and negative/benign case groups). Regression analysis of ORs also indicated a significant increase trend in slope (P = .006).
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the risk scores computed by a new support vector machine model involving bilateral mammographic feature asymmetry have potential to assist the prediction of near-term risk of women for developing breast cancer."

We compared the 5-year and lifetime risk produced using the modified Gail model which applied Korean incidence and mortality data and the parameter estimators from the original Gail model with those produced using the KoBCRAT. We validated the KoBCRAT based on the expected/observed breast cancer incidence and area under the curve (AUC) using two Korean cohorts: the Korean Multicenter Cancer Cohort (KMCC) and National Cancer Center (NCC) cohort.
Results: The major risk factors under the age of 50 were family history, age at menarche, age at first full-term pregnancy, menopausal status, breastfeeding duration, oral contraceptive usage, and exercise, while those at and over the age of 50 were family history, age at menarche, age at menopause, pregnancy experience, body mass index, oral contraceptive usage, and exercise.

Methods: We assessed calibration and discrimination of the CARE model in the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS) with data from 45 942 women aged 30 to 69 years at baseline.
Results: During a mean follow-up of 9.5 years, we identified 852 invasive breast cancers. The CARE model predicted 749.6 breast cancers, yielding an expected-to-observed (E/O) ratio of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.82 to 0.94). The E/O ratio did not appreciably differ between women aged less than 50 years and those aged 50 years or older. The model underpredicted risk to the greatest degree among women aged 25 years or older at birth of first child (E/O = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.63 to 0.81); the model was well calibrated among women aged less than 25 years at birth of first child. The prevalence of later age at birth of first child was higher in the BWHS than in the CARE study, and breast cancer incidence was higher in the BWHS compared with national rates used in the CARE model. With respect to discriminatory accuracy, the concordance statistic was 0.57 (95% CI = 0.55 to 0.59) for breast cancer overall, 0.59 (95% CI = 0.57 to 0.61) for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, and 0.54 (95% CI = 0.50 to 0.57) for ER-negative breast cancer.
Conclusions: The CARE model underpredicted breast cancer risk in the BWHS, at least in part because of older age at first birth in this cohort, which led to higher breast cancer incidence rates. Our results suggest that inclusion of age at first birth may improve model performance. Discriminatory accuracy was modest and worse for ER-negative breast cancer."

Methods: Data were pooled from six studies including 3414 women with breast cancer and 7199 without who underwent screening mammography. Percent MD was assessed from digitized film-screen mammograms using a computer-assisted threshold technique. We used polytomous logistic regression to calculate breast cancer odds according to tumor type, histopathological characteristics, and receptor (estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)) status by age (<55, 55-64, and 鈮 65 years).
Results: MD was positively associated with risk of invasive tumors across all ages, with a two-fold increased risk for high (>51%) versus average density (11-25%). Women ages <55 years with high MD had stronger increased risk of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) compared to women ages 55-64 and 鈮 65 years (P(age-interaction) = 0.02). Among all ages, MD had a stronger association with large (>2.1 cm) versus small tumors and positive versus negative lymph node status (P's < 0.01).

Most GWASs to date have been conducted in women of European descent, however, and the contribution of these variants as predictors in Japanese women is unknown. Here, we analyzed 23 genetic variants identified in previous GWASs and conducted a case-control study with 697 case subjects and 1,394 age- and menopausal status-matched controls. We fit conditional regression models with genetic variants and conventional risk factors. In addition, we created a polygenetic risk score, using those variants with a statistically significant association with breast cancer risk, and also evaluated the contribution of these genetic predictors using the c statistic. Eleven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) revealed significant associations with breast cancer risk. A dose-dependent association was observed between the risk of breast cancer and the genetic risk score, which was an aggregate measure of alleles in seven selected variants, namely FGFR2-rs2981579, TOX3/TNRC9-rs3803662, C6orf97-rs2046210, 8q24-rs13281615, SLC4A7-rs4973768, LSP1-rs38137198, and CASP8-rs10931936.

Objective MD measurement in a high-throughput fashion would enable its wider use as a biomarker for breast cancer. We use a public domain image-processing software for the fully automated analysis of MD and penalized regression to construct a measure that mimics a well-established semiautomated measure (Cumulus). We also describe measures that incorporate additional features of mammographic images for improving the risk associations of MD and breast cancer risk.
Methods: We randomly partitioned our dataset into a training set for model building (733 cases, 748 controls) and a test set for model assessment (765 cases, 747 controls). The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r) was used to compare the MD measurements by Cumulus and our automated measure, which mimics Cumulus. The likelihood ratio test was used to validate the performance of logistic regression models for breast cancer risk, which included our measure capturing additional information in mammographic images.
Results: We observed a high correlation between the Cumulus measure and our measure mimicking Cumulus (r = 0.884; 95% CI, 0.872 to 0.894) in an external test set. Adding a variable, which includes extra information to percentage density, significantly improved the fit of the logistic regression model of breast cancer risk (P = 0.0002).
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the potential to facilitate the integration of mammographic density measurements into large-scale research studies and subsequently into clinical practice."

First results from such models showed modest benefits in terms of risk discrimination. Heterogeneity of breast cancer as defined by hormone-receptor status has not been considered in this context. In this study we investigated the predictive capacity of 32 GWAS-detected common variants for breast cancer risk, alone and in combination with classical risk factors, and for tumours with different hormone receptor status.
Material and methods: Within the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium, we analysed 6009 invasive breast cancer cases and 7827 matched controls of European ancestry, with data on classical breast cancer risk factors and 32 common gene variants identified through GWAS. Discriminatory ability with respect to breast cancer of specific hormone receptor-status was assessed with the age adjusted and cohort-adjusted concordance statistic (AUROC(a)). Absolute risk scores were calculated with external reference data. Integrated discrimination improvement was used to measure improvements in risk prediction.
Results: We found a small but steady increase in discriminatory ability with increasing numbers of genetic variants included in the model (difference in AUROC(a) going from 2.7% to 4%). Discriminatory ability for all models varied strongly by hormone receptor status.
Discussion and conclusions: Adding information on common polymorphisms provides small but statistically significant improvements in the quality of breast cancer risk prediction models. We consistently observed better performance for receptor-positive cases, but the gain in discriminatory quality is not sufficient for clinical application."

However, the validity of the model for projecting risk in South-East Asian women is uncertain. We evaluated GAIL and attempted to improve its performance for Singapore women of Chinese, Malay and Indian origins.
Methods: Data from the Singapore Breast Screening Programme (SBSP) are used. Motivated by lower breast cancer incidence in many Asian countries, we utilised race-specific invasive breast cancer and other cause mortality rates for Singapore women to produce GAIL-SBSP. By using risk factor information from a nested case-control study within SBSP, alternative models incorporating fewer then additional risk factors were determined. Their accuracy was assessed by comparing the expected cases (E) with the observed (O) by the ratio (E/O) and 95% confidence interval (CI) and the respective concordance statistics estimated.
Results: From 28,883 women, GAIL-SBSP predicted 241.83 cases during the 5-year follow-up while 241 were reported (E/O=1.00, CI=0.88 to 1.14). Except for women who had two or more first-degree-relatives with breast cancer, satisfactory prediction was present in almost all risk categories. This agreement was reflected in Chinese and Malay, but not in Indian women. We also found that a simplified model (S-GAIL-SBSP) including only age-at-menarche, age-at-birth of first live child and number of first-degree-relatives performed similarly with associated concordance statistics of 0.5997. Taking account of body mass index and parity did not improve the calibration of S-GAIL-SBSP.
Conclusions: GAIL can be refined by using national race-specific invasive breast cancer rates and mortality rates for causes other than breast cancer. A revised model containing only three variables (S-GAIL-SBSP) provides a simpler approach for projecting absolute risk of invasive breast cancer in South-East Asia women.

Methods: We investigate the performance of an up-to-date 18 breast cancer risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), together with mammographic percentage density (PD), body mass index (BMI) and clinical risk factors in predicting absolute risk of breast cancer, empirically, in a well characterised Swedish case-control study of postmenopausal women. We examined the efficiency of various prediction models at a population level for individualised screening by extending a recently proposed analytical approach for estimating number of cases captured.
Results: The performance of a risk prediction model based on an initial set of seven breast cancer risk SNPs is improved by additionally including eleven more recently established breast cancer risk SNPs (P = 4.69 脳 10-4). Adding mammographic PD, BMI and all 18 SNPs to a Swedish Gail model improved the discriminatory accuracy (the AUC statistic) from 55% to 62%. The net reclassification improvement was used to assess improvement in classification of women into low, intermediate, and high categories of 5-year risk (P = 8.93 脳 10-9). For scenarios we considered, we estimated that an individualised screening strategy based on risk models incorporating clinical risk factors, mammographic density and SNPs, captures 10% more cases than a screening strategy using the same resources, based on age alone. Estimates of numbers of cases captured by screening stratified by age provide insight into how individualised screening programs might appear in practice.
Conclusions: Taken together, genetic risk factors and mammographic density offer moderate improvements to clinical risk factor models for predicting breast cancer."

However, most of the studies were conducted among Caucasians and only one from Chinese.
Methods: In the current study, we first tested whether 15 SNPs identified by previous GWAS were also breast cancer marker SNPs in this Chinese population. Then, we grouped the marker SNPs, and modeled them with clinical risk factors, to see the usage of these factors in breast cancer risk assessment. Two methods (risk factors counting and odds ratio (OR) weighted risk scoring) were used to evaluate the cumulative effects of the five significant SNPs and two clinical risk factors (age at menarche and age at first live birth).
Results: Five SNPs located at 2q35, 3p24, 6q22, 6q25 and 10q26 were consistently associated with breast cancer risk in both testing set (878 cases and 900 controls) and validation set (914 cases and 967 controls) samples. Overall, all of the five SNPs contributed to breast cancer susceptibility in a dominant genetic model (2q35, rs13387042: adjusted OR = 1.26, P = 0.006; 3q24.1, rs2307032: adjusted OR = 1.24, P = 0.005; 6q22.33, rs2180341: adjusted OR = 1.22, P = 0.006; 6q25.1, rs2046210: adjusted OR = 1.51, P = 2.40 脳 10-8; 10q26.13, rs2981582: adjusted OR = 1.31, P = 1.96 脳 10-4).

Although the GM has been validated in several Western studies, its applicability outside North America and Europe remains uncertain. The Singapore Breast Cancer Screening Project (SBCSP) is a nation-wide prospective trial of screening mammography conducted between Oct 1994 and Feb 1997, and is the only such trial conducted outside North America and Europe to date. With the long-term outcomes from this study, we sought to evaluate the performance of GM in prediction of individual breast cancer risk in a Asian developed country.
Methods: The study population consisted of 28,104 women aged 50 to 64 years who participated in the SBSCP and did not have breast cancer detected during screening. The national cancer registry was used to identify incident cases of breast cancer. To evaluate the performance of the GM, we compared the expected number of invasive breast cancer cases predicted by the model to the actual number of cases observed within 5-year and 10-year follow-up. Pearson's Chi-square test was used to test the goodness of fit between the expected and observed cases of invasive breast cancers.
Results: The ratio of expected to observed number of invasive breast cancer cases within 5 years from screening was 2.51 (95% confidence interval 2.14 - 2.96). The GM over-estimated breast cancer risk across all age groups, with the discrepancy being highest among older women aged 60 - 64 years (E/O = 3.53, 95% CI = 2.57-4.85). The model also over-estimated risk for the upper 80% of women with highest predicted risk. The overall E/O ratio for the 10-year predicted breast cancer risk was 1.85 (1.68-2.04).
Conclusions: The GM over-predicts the risk of invasive breast cancer in the setting of a developed Asian country as demonstrated in a large prospective trial, with the largest difference seen in older women aged between 60 and 64 years old. The reason for the discrepancy is likely to be multifactorial, including a truly lower prevalence of breast cancer, as well as lower mammographic screening prevalence locally."

Methods: We developed a model that simulates the kinetic effect of genetic variants of the enzymes CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and COMT on the production of the main carcinogenic estrogen metabolite, 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-OHE(2)), expressed as area under the curve metric (4-OHE(2)-AUC). The model also incorporates phenotypic factors (age, body mass index, hormone replacement therapy, oral contraceptives, and family history), which plausibly influence estrogen metabolism and the production of 4-OHE(2). We applied the model to two independent, population-based breast cancer case-control groups, the German GENICA study (967 cases, 971 controls) and the Nashville Breast Cohort (NBC; 465 cases, 885 controls).
Results: In the GENICA study, premenopausal women at the 90th percentile of 4-OHE(2)-AUC among control subjects had a risk of breast cancer that was 2.30 times that of women at the 10th control 4-OHE(2)-AUC percentile (95% CI: 1.7-3.2, P = 2.9 脳 10(-7)). This relative risk was 1.89 (95% CI: 1.5-2.4, P = 2.2 脳 10(-8)) in postmenopausal women.

No risk assessment model that incorporates both genetic and clinical predictors is currently available to predict breast cancer risk in this population.
Methods: We analyzed 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in recent genome-wide association studies mostly of women of European ancestry as being associated with the risk of breast cancer in 3039 case patients and 3082 control subjects who participated in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study. All participants were interviewed in person to obtain information regarding known and suspected risk factors for breast cancer. The c statistic, a measure of discrimination ability with a value ranging from 0.5 (random classification) to 1.0 (perfect classification), was estimated to evaluate the contribution of genetic and established clinical predictors of breast cancer to a newly established risk assessment model for Chinese women. Clinical predictors included in the model were age at menarche, age at first live birth, waist-to-hip ratio, family history of breast cancer, and a previous diagnosis of benign breast disease. The utility of the models in risk stratification was evaluated by estimating the proportion of breast cancer patients in the general population that could be accounted for above a given risk threshold as predicted by the models. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: Eight SNPs (rs2046210, rs1219648, rs3817198, rs8051542, rs3803662, rs889312, rs10941679, and rs13281615), each of which reflected a genetically independent locus, were found to be associated with the risk of breast cancer. A dose-response association was observed between the risk of breast cancer and the genetic risk score, which is an aggregate measure of the effect of these eight SNPs (odds ratio for women in the highest quintile of genetic risk score vs those in the lowest = 1.85, 95% confidence interval = 1.58 to 2.18, P(trend) = 2.5 x 10(-15)). The genetic risk score, the waist-to-hip ratio, and a previous diagnosis of benign breast disease were the top three predictors of the risk of breast cancer, each contributing statistically significantly (P < .001) to the full risk assessment model. The model, with a c statistic of 0.6295 after adjustment for overfitting, showed promise for stratifying women into different risk groups; women in the top 30% risk group accounted for nearly 50% of the breast cancers diagnosed in the general population.

Results: Over a median follow-up of 14.6 years, 64 (19%) of the 331 women developed invasive breast cancer. In the first 10 years after biopsy, 31 women developed invasive breast cancer whereas the Tyrer-Cuzick model predicted 58.9. The observed-to-predicted ratio was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.75).

In this study, the authors have evaluated whether an artificial neural network (ANN) trained on a large prospectively collected dataset of consecutive mammography findings can discriminate between benign and malignant disease and accurately predict the probability of breast cancer for individual patients.
Methods: Our dataset consisted of 62,219 consecutively collected mammography findings matched with the Wisconsin State Cancer Reporting System. The authors built a 3-layer feedforward ANN with 1000 hidden-layer nodes. The authors trained and tested their ANN by using 10-fold cross-validation to predict the risk of breast cancer. The authors used area the under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity to evaluate discriminative performance of the radiologists and their ANN. The authors assessed the accuracy of risk prediction (ie, calibration) of their ANN by using the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) goodness-of-fit test.
Results: Their ANN demonstrated superior discrimination (AUC, 0.965) compared with the radiologists (AUC, 0.939; P<.001). The authors' ANN was also well calibrated as shown by an H-L goodness of fit P-value of .13.

Methods: Blood samples were collected from 121 females referred for diagnostic mammography following an initial suspicious screening mammogram. Diagnostic work-up revealed that 67 of these women had breast cancer while 54 had no malignant disease. Additionally, nine samples from six healthy female controls were included. Gene expression analyses were conducted using high density oligonucleotide microarrays. Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) was used for model building while a leave-one-out (LOO) double cross validation approach was used to identify predictors and estimate their prediction efficiency.
Results: A set of 738 probes that discriminated breast cancer and non-breast cancer samples was identified. By cross validation we achieved an estimated prediction accuracy of 79.5% with a sensitivity of 80.6% and a specificity of 78.3%. The genes deregulated in blood of breast cancer patients are related to functional processes such as defense response, translation, and various metabolic processes, such as lipid- and steroid metabolism.

Tissue-based features may help to stratify women into different risk levels. Breast lobules are the anatomic sites of origin of breast cancer. As women age, these lobular structures should regress, which results in reduced breast cancer risk. However, this does not occur in all women.
Methods: We have quantified the extent of lobule regression on a benign breast biopsy in 85 patients who developed breast cancer and 142 age-matched controls from the Mayo Benign Breast Disease Cohort, by determining number of acini per lobule and lobular area. We also calculated Gail model 5-year predicted risks for these women.
Results: There is a step-wise increase in breast cancer risk with increasing numbers of acini per lobule (P = .0004). Adjusting for Gail model score, parity, histology, and family history did not attenuate this association. Lobular area was similarly associated with risk. The Gail model estimates were associated with risk of breast cancer (P = .03). We examined the individual accuracy of these measures using the concordance (c) statistic. The Gail model c statistic was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.70); the acinar count c statistic was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.75). Combining acinar count and lobular area, the c statistic was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.78). Adding the Gail model to these measures did not improve the c statistic.
Conclusion: Novel, tissue-based features that reflect the status of a woman's normal breast lobules are associated with breast cancer risk. These features may offer a novel strategy for risk prediction."

The sample was split into training (123 cases and 258 controls) and validation (123 cases and 264 controls) data sets. Age-adjusted and body mass index (BMI)-adjusted odds ratios (OR) per SD change in the feature, 95% confidence intervals, and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) were obtained using logistic regression. A bootstrap approach was used to identify the strongest features in the training data set, and results for features that validated in the second half of the sample were reported using the full data set. The mean age at mammography was 64.0+/-10.2 years, and the mean time from mammography to breast cancer was 3.7+/-1.0 (range, 2.0-5.9 years). PD was associated with breast cancer risk (OR, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.78). The strongest features that validated from each of several classes (Markovian, run length, Laws, wavelet, and Fourier) showed similar ORs as PD and predicted breast cancer at a similar magnitude (AUC=0.58-0.60) as PD (AUC=0.58).

Investigating the genetic models for mammographic density may provide further insights into the genetic factors affecting breast cancer risk.
Purpose: To evaluate the familial aggregation of MBD and investigate the genetic models of susceptibility.
Methods: We used data on 746 women from 305 families participating in the Sisters in Breast Screening study. Retrieved mammograms were digitized, and percent mammographic density was determined using the Cumulus software. Linear regression analysis was done to identify the factors that are associated with mammographic density and a multivariate regression model was constructed. Familial correlations between relative pairs were calculated using the residuals from these models. Genetic models of susceptibility were investigated using segregation analysis.
Results: After adjusting for covariates, the intraclass correlation coefficient among the residuals was 0.26 (95% confidence interval, 0.16-0.36) in sister-sister pairs and 0.67 (0.27-1.00) among the monozygotic twin pairs. The most parsimonious model was a Mendelian single major gene model in which an allele with population frequency 0.39 (95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.46) influenced mammographic density in an additive fashion. This model explained 66% of the residual variance.
Conclusion: These results confirm that MBD has a strong heritable basis, and suggest that major genes may explain some of the familial aggregation. These results may have implications for the search of genes that control mammographic density."

However, this model underestimates breast cancer risk in African-American women. The Contraceptive and Reproductive Experience (CARE) model has been developed to replace the Gail model in predicting breast cancer risk in African-American women. In a sample of 883 women who participated in the breast cancer screening program at Howard University Cancer Center, we compared the breast cancer risk estimates from the Gail model and the CARE model. The mean 5-year breast cancer risk was 0.88% (Range: 0.18-6.60%) for the Gail model and 1.29% (Range: 0.20-4.50%) for the CARE model. Using the usual cutoff-point of 1.67% or above for elevated risk, there is a significant difference in the proportion of women with elevated breast cancer risk between the Gail and the CARE models (McNemar's test, p < 0.0001). For both models, there was a significant mean risk difference between those with and without a family history of breast cancer (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.0001). Our results confirm the need for validation of the Gail model in African-Americans and diversity in research.

Methods: From January 1993 to December 2003, data that included American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density categories (1-4 in order of increasing density) were collected prospectively on 301,955 women aged 30 and older who were not using postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy and underwent at least two screening mammography examinations; 2639 of the women were diagnosed with breast cancer within 1 year of the last examination. Women's first and last BI-RADS breast density (average 3.2 years apart) and logistic regression were used to model the odds of having invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosed within 12 months of the last examination by change in BI-RADS category. Rates of breast cancer adjusted for age, mammography registry, and time between screening examinations were estimated from this model. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: The rate (breast cancers per 1000 women) of breast cancer was higher if BI-RADS breast density category increased from 1 to 2 (5.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.7 to 6.9) or 1 to 3 (9.9, 95% CI = 6.4 to 15.5) compared to when it remained at BI-RADS density of 1 (3.0, 95% CI = 2.3 to 3.9; P<.001 for trend). Similar and statistically significant trends between increased or decreased density and increased or decreased risk of breast cancer, respectively, were observed for women whose breast density category was initially 2 or 3 and changed categories. BI-RADS density of 4 on the first examination was associated with a high rate of breast cancer (range 9.1-13.4) that remained high even if breast density decreased.
Conclusion: An increase in BI-RADS breast density category within 3 years may be associated with an increase in breast cancer risk and a decrease in density category with a decrease in risk compared to breast cancer risk in women in whom breast density category remains unchanged. Two longitudinal measures of BI-RADS breast density may better predict a woman's risk of breast cancer than a single measure."

We evaluated and attempted to improve the performance of the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (i.e., the Gail model) for estimating invasive breast cancer risk by receptor status in postmenopausal women.
Methods: In The Women's Health Initiative cohort, breast cancer risk estimates from the Gail model and models incorporating additional or fewer risk factors and 5-year incidence of ER-positive and ER-negative invasive breast cancers were determined and compared by use of receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve (AUC) statistics. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: Among 147,916 eligible women, 3236 were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. The overall AUC for the Gail model was 0.58 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.56 to 0.60). The Gail model underestimated 5-year invasive breast cancer incidence by approximately 20% (P<.001), mostly among those with a low estimated risk. Discriminatory performance was better for the risk of ER-positive cancer (AUC = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.58 to 0.62) than for the risk of ER-negative cancer (AUC = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.54). Age and age at menopause were statistically significantly associated with ER-positive but not ER-negative cancers (P=.05 and P=.04 for heterogeneity, respectively). For ER-positive cancers, no additional risk factors substantially improved the Gail model prediction. However, a simpler model that included only age, breast cancer in first-degree relatives, and previous breast biopsy examination performed similarly for ER-positive breast cancer prediction (AUC=0.58, 95% CI= 0.56 to 0.60); postmenopausal women who were 55 years or older with either a previous breast biopsy examination or a family history of breast cancer had a 5-year breast cancer risk of 1.8% or higher.

Methods: A pedigree assessment tool (PAT) was designed to identify women in primary care settings who are at increased risk for hereditary breast cancer, including potential BRCA mutation carriers. The PAT is a simple point-scoring system based on family cancer history with points weighted to account for features associated with a higher probability that a BRCA mutation is present. The ability of the PAT and the Gail model to accurately identify potential BRCA mutation carriers in 3,906 women without a personal history of breast cancer presenting for a screening mammogram at a community hospital was tested.
Results: Eighty-six (2.2%) women had a family history indicative of a high probability (>10%) that a BRCA mutation was present within the family. The PAT performed better than the Gail model in correctly assigning women to the ""high BRCA probability"" cohort. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the PAT was 0.9625 compared with 0.389 and 0.5861 for the Gail model 5-year and lifetime risk estimates, respectively.

Results: The model fit well in the total sample (ratio of expected [E] to observed [O] numbers of cases = 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.89 to 0.99). Underprediction was slightly greater for younger women (<60 years), but in most age and risk factor strata, E/O ratios were close to 1.0. The model fit equally well (E/O ratio = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.87 to 0.99) in a subset of women reporting recent screening (i.e., within 1 year before the baseline); among women with an estimated 5-year risk of developing invasive breast cancer of 1.67% or greater, the E/O ratio was 1.04 (95% CI = 0.96 to 1.12). The concordance statistic, which indicates discriminatory accuracy, for the Gail et al. model 2 when used to estimate 5-year risk was 0.58 (95% CI = 0.56 to 0.60). Only 3.3% of the 1354 cases of breast cancer observed in the cohort arose among women who fell into age-risk strata expected to have statistically significant net health benefits from prophylactic tamoxifen use.
Conclusions: The Gail et al. model 2 fit well in this sample in terms of predicting numbers of breast cancer cases in specific risk factor strata but had modest discriminatory accuracy at the individual level. This finding has implications for use of the model in clinical counseling of individual women."

Such estimates are useful in decision making on the part of women, in designing prevention trials, and in targeting screening and prevention efforts.
Purpose: Our purpose was to evaluate the ability of the model to accurately predict individual breast cancer risk, using a large population independent of the one from which the model was derived.
Methods: We compared the number of cancer cases predicted by the model to the actual number of cases observed in the Nurses' Health Study. The study population was 115,172 women who did not have breast cancer at the beginning of the study. Questionnaires were sent to participants every 2 years, seeking data on risk factors and diagnoses of breast cancer. Follow-up compliance was 95% over the 12-year study period.
Results: The model over-predicted absolute breast cancer risk by 33% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 28%-39%), with the overprediction more than twofold among premenopausal women (95% CI = 1.9-2.2), among women with extensive family history of breast cancer (95% CI = 1.1-3.9), and among women with age at first birth younger than 20 years (95% CI = 1.3-4.7). The correlation coefficient between observed and predicted risk was 0.67, indicating that the model is less than satisfactory for ranking individual levels of breast cancer risk. Overprediction occurred at all deciles of predicted risk.
Conclusions: The model's performance is unsatisfactory for estimating breast cancer risk for individual women aged 25-61 years who do not participate in annual screening. Lower mammography screening rates in the Nurses' Health Study may account for some, but not all, of the discrepancy between observed and predicted cases.
Implications: A recent modification of the model by the tamoxifen trial investigators is likely to have provided accurate power calculations. This modified form of the model should be useful for planning other large, population-based studies."

Purpose: We evaluated the model prospectively in a cohort of women with a family history of breast cancer.
Methods: We followed women who participated in the American Cancer Society 1987 Texas Breast Screening Project. The model was evaluated by comparing the observed (O) and expected (E) numbers of breast cancers using composite background rates from both the Breast Cancer Detection and Demonstration Project and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program of the National Cancer Institute.

Results: The final dataset included 99,319 women. Of these, 745 (0.75%) had CIN2+. The multivariable model had a C-statistic of 0.81. All factors but race were independently associated with CIN2+. The model categorized women as having below-average CIN2+ risk (0.15% predicted vs. 0.12% observed risk), average CIN2+ risk (0.42% predicted vs. 0.36% observed), and above-average CIN2+ risk (1.76% predicted vs. 1.85% observed). Before screening, women at below-average risk had a risk of CIN2+ well below that of women with ASCUS and HPV negative (0.12 vs. 0.20%).

We used multivariate linear regression models to identify predictors of CC incidence in 40 countries. We extracted age-specific HPV prevalence (10-year age groups) by country from a meta-analysis in women with normal cytology (N = 40) and matched to most recent CC incidence rates from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents when available (N = 36), or Globocan 2008 (N = 4). We evaluated country-level behavioral, economic, and public health indicators. CC incidence was significantly associated with age-specific HPV prevalence in women aged 35-64 (adjusted R-squared 0.41) (""base model""). Adding geographic region to the base model increased the adjusted R-squared to 0.77, but the further addition of screening was not statistically significant. Similarly, country-level macro-indicators did not improve predictive validity. Age-specific HPV prevalence at older ages was found to be a better predictor of CC incidence than prevalence in women under 35. However, HPV prevalence could not explain the entire CC burden as many factors modify women's risk of progression to cancer. Geographic region seemed to serve as a proxy for these country-level indicators. Our analysis supports the assertion that conducting a population-based HPV survey targeting women over age 35 can be valuable in approximating the CC risk in a given country."

Results: Six SNPs (rs6983267, rs4779584, rs4444235, rs9929218, rs10936599, rs16969681) from 23 SNPs by European-based GWAS and five SNPs (rs704017, rs11196172, rs10774214, rs647161, rs2423279) among ten SNPs by Asian-based GWAS were selected in CRC risk prediction model. Compared with a 6-SNP-based model, an 11-SNP model including Asian GWAS-SNPs showed improved discrimination capacity in Receiver operator characteristic analysis. A model with 11 SNPs resulted in statistically significant improvement in both derivation (P = 0.0039) and replication studies (P = 0.0018) compared with six SNP model. We estimated cumulative risk of CRC by using genetic risk group based on 11 SNPs and found that the cumulative risk at age 80 is approximately 13% in the high-risk group while 6% in the low-risk group.

By screening high-density protein microarrays with sera from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and controls, we identified 16 tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) exhibiting high diagnostic value. This high number of TAAs requires the development of multiplex assays combining different antigens for a faster and more accurate prediction of CRC. Here, we have developed and optimized a bead-based assay using nine selected TAAs and two controls to provide a multiplex test for early CRC diagnosis. We screened a collection of 307 CRC patients' and control sera with the beads assay to identify and validate the best TAA combination for CRC detection. The multiplex bead-based assay exhibited a similar diagnostic performance to detect the humoral response in comparison to multiple ELISA analyses. After multivariate analysis, a panel composed of GTF2B, EDIL3, HCK, PIM1, STK4, and p53, together with gender and age, was identified as the best combination of TAAs for CRC diagnosis, achieving an AUC of 89.7%, with 66% sensitivity at 90.0% fixed specificity.

Here, we develop and validate a model to identify individuals at increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) by analyzing blood counts, age, and sex, then determine the model's value when used to supplement conventional screening.
Materials and methods: Primary care data were collected from a cohort of 606 403 Israelis (of whom 3135 were diagnosed with CRC) and a case control UK dataset of 5061 CRC cases and 25 613 controls. The model was developed on 80% of the Israeli dataset and validated using the remaining Israeli and UK datasets. Performance was evaluated according to the area under the curve, specificity, and odds ratio at several working points.
Results: Using blood counts obtained 3-6 months before diagnosis, the area under the curve for detecting CRC was 0.82 卤 0.01 for the Israeli validation set. The specificity was 88 卤 2% in the Israeli validation set and 94 卤 1% in the UK dataset. Detecting 50% of CRC cases, the odds ratio was 26 卤 5 and 40 卤 6, respectively, for a false-positive rate of 0.5%. Specificity for 50% detection was 87 卤 2% a year before diagnosis and 85 卤 2% for localized cancers. When used in addition to the fecal occult blood test, our model enabled more than a 2-fold increase in CRC detection.
Discussion: Comparable results in 2 unrelated populations suggest that the model should generally apply to the detection of CRC in other groups. The model's performance is superior to current iron deficiency anemia management guidelines, and may help physicians to identify individuals requiring additional clinical evaluation.
Conclusions: Our model may help to detect CRC earlier in clinical practice."

To aid in the development of screening strategies, we refined models designed to determine risk of CRC by incorporating information from common genetic susceptibility loci.
Methods: By using data collected from more than 12,000 participants in 6 studies performed from 1990 through 2011 in the United States and Germany, we developed risk determination models based on sex, age, family history, genetic risk score (number of risk alleles carried at 27 validated common CRC susceptibility loci), and history of endoscopic examinations. The model was validated using data collected from approximately 1800 participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, conducted from 1993 through 2001 in the United States.
Results: We identified a CRC genetic risk score that independently predicted which patients in the training set would develop CRC. Compared with determination of risk based only on family history, adding the genetic risk score increased the discriminatory accuracy from 0.51 to 0.59 (P = .0028) for men and from 0.52 to 0.56 (P = .14) for women. We calculated age- and sex-specific 10-year CRC absolute risk estimates based on the number of risk alleles, family history, and history of endoscopic examinations. A model that included a genetic risk score better determined the recommended starting age for screening in subjects with and without family histories of CRC. The starting age for high-risk men (family history of CRC and genetic risk score, 90%) was 42 years, and for low-risk men (no family history of CRC and genetic risk score, 10%) was 52 years. For men with no family history and a high genetic risk score (90%), the starting age would be 47 years; this is an intermediate value that is 5 years earlier than it would be for men with a genetic risk score of 10%. Similar trends were observed in women.
Conclusions: By incorporating information on CRC risk alleles, we created a model to determine the risk for CRC more accurately. This model might be used to develop screening and prevention strategies."

Integrating a genomic screening profile as a component of existing screening programs for CRC could potentially improve the effectiveness of population screening by allowing the assignment of individuals to different types and intensities of screening and also by potentially increasing the uptake of existing screening programs. We evaluated the utility and predictive value of genomic profiling as applied to CRC, and as a potential component of a population-based cancer screening program. We generated simulated data representing a typical North American population including a variety of genetic profiles, with a range of relative risks and prevalences for individual risk genes. We then used these data to estimate parameters characterizing the predictive value of a logistic regression model built on genetic markers for CRC. Meta-analyses of genetic associations with CRC were used in building science to inform the simulation work, and to select genetic variants to include in logistic regression model-building using data from the ARCTIC study in Ontario, which included 1,200 CRC cases and a similar number of cancer-free population-based controls. Our simulations demonstrate that for reasonable assumptions involving modest relative risks for individual genetic variants, that substantial predictive power can be achieved when risk variants are common (e.g., prevalence > 20%) and data for enough risk variants are available (e.g., approximately 140-160). Pilot work in population data shows modest, but statistically significant predictive utility for a small collection of risk variants, smaller in effect than age and gender alone in predicting an individual's CRC risk.

Patients and methods: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) -American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) diet and health study, a prospective cohort study, was used to validate the model. Men and women age 50 to 71 years at baseline answered self-administered questionnaires that asked about demographic characteristics, diet, lifestyle, and medical histories. We compared expected numbers of CRC patient cases predicted by the model to the observed numbers of CRC patient cases identified in the NIH-AARP study overall and in subgroups defined by risk factor combinations. The discriminatory power was measured by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC).
Results: During an average of 6.9 years of follow-up, we identified 2,092 and 832 incident CRC patient cases in men and women, respectively. The overall expected/observed ratio was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.95 to 1.04) in men and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.11) in women. Agreement between the expected and the observed number of cases was good in most risk factor categories, except for in subgroups defined by CRC screening and polyp history. This discrepancy may be caused by differences in the question on screening and polyp history between two studies. The AUC was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.62) for men and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.62) for women, which was similar to other risk prediction models.

Patients and methods: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) -American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) diet and health study, a prospective cohort study, was used to validate the model. Men and women age 50 to 71 years at baseline answered self-administered questionnaires that asked about demographic characteristics, diet, lifestyle, and medical histories. We compared expected numbers of CRC patient cases predicted by the model to the observed numbers of CRC patient cases identified in the NIH-AARP study overall and in subgroups defined by risk factor combinations. The discriminatory power was measured by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC).
Results: During an average of 6.9 years of follow-up, we identified 2,092 and 832 incident CRC patient cases in men and women, respectively. The overall expected/observed ratio was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.95 to 1.04) in men and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.11) in women. Agreement between the expected and the observed number of cases was good in most risk factor categories, except for in subgroups defined by CRC screening and polyp history. This discrepancy may be caused by differences in the question on screening and polyp history between two studies. The AUC was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.62) for men and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.62) for women, which was similar to other risk prediction models.
Conclusion: The absolute risk model for CRC was well calibrated in a large prospective cohort study. This prediction model, which estimates an individual's risk of CRC given age and risk factors, may be a useful tool for physicians, researchers, and policy makers."

Methods: We examined a set of 72 PNs (31 benign and 41 malignant) from the Lung Image Database Consortium image collection (LIDC-IDRI). One hundred three CT radiomic features were extracted from each PN. Before the model building process, distinctive features were identified using a hierarchical clustering method. We then constructed a prediction model by using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier coupled with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). A tenfold cross-validation (CV) was repeated ten times (10 脳 10-fold CV) to evaluate the accuracy of the SVM-LASSO model. Finally, the best model from the 10 脳 10-fold CV was further evaluated using 20 脳 5- and 50 脳 2-fold CVs.
Results: The best SVM-LASSO model consisted of only two features: the bounding box anterior-posterior dimension (BB_AP) and the standard deviation of inverse difference moment (SD_IDM). The BB_AP measured the extension of a PN in the anterior-posterior direction and was highly correlated (r = 0.94) with the PN size. The SD_IDM was a texture feature that measured the directional variation of the local homogeneity feature IDM. Univariate analysis showed that both features were statistically significant and discriminative (P = 0.00013 and 0.000038, respectively). PNs with larger BB_AP or smaller SD_IDM were more likely malignant. The 10 脳 10-fold CV of the best SVM model using the two features achieved an accuracy of 84.6% and 0.89 AUC. By comparison, Lung-RADS achieved an accuracy of 72.2% and 0.77 AUC using four features (size, type, calcification, and spiculation). The prediction improvement of SVM-LASSO comparing to Lung-RADS was statistically significant (McNemar's test P = 0.026). Lung-RADS misclassified 19 cases because it was mainly based on PN size, whereas the SVM-LASSO model correctly classified 10 of these cases by combining a size (BB_AP) feature and a texture (SD_IDM) feature. The performance of the SVM-LASSO model was stable when leaving more patients out with five- and twofold CVs (accuracy 84.1% and 81.6%, respectively).

Objective: To investigate whether a lung cancer risk prediction model based on a panel of selected circulating protein biomarkers can outperform a traditional risk prediction model and current US screening criteria.
Design, setting, and participants: Prediagnostic samples from 108 ever-smoking patients with lung cancer diagnosed within 1 year after blood collection and samples from 216 smoking-matched controls from the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) cohort were used to develop a biomarker risk score based on 4 proteins (cancer antigen 125 [CA125], carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], cytokeratin-19 fragment [CYFRA 21-1], and the precursor form of surfactant protein B [Pro-SFTPB]). The biomarker score was subsequently validated blindly using absolute risk estimates among 63 ever-smoking patients with lung cancer diagnosed within 1 year after blood collection and 90 matched controls from 2 large European population-based cohorts, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study (NSHDS).
Main outcomes and measures: Model validity in discriminating between future lung cancer cases and controls. Discrimination estimates were weighted to reflect the background populations of EPIC and NSHDS validation studies (area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve [AUC], sensitivity, and specificity).
Results: In the validation study of 63 ever-smoking patients with lung cancer and 90 matched controls (mean [SD] age, 57.7 [8.7] years; 68.6% men) from EPIC and NSHDS, an integrated risk prediction model that combined smoking exposure with the biomarker score yielded an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.90) compared with 0.73 (95% CI, 0.64-0.82) for a model based on smoking exposure alone (P = .003 for difference in AUC). At an overall specificity of 0.83, based on the US Preventive Services Task Force screening criteria, the sensitivity of the integrated risk prediction (biomarker) model was 0.63 compared with 0.43 for the smoking model. Conversely, at an overall sensitivity of 0.42, based on the US Preventive Services Task Force screening criteria, the integrated risk prediction model yielded a specificity of 0.95 compared with 0.86 for the smoking model.
Conclusions and relevance: This study provided a proof of principle in showing that a panel of circulating protein biomarkers may improve lung cancer risk assessment and may be used to define eligibility for computed tomography screening."

Methods: Solid non-calcified nodules detected during incidence screening rounds of the randomised controlled Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening (NELSON) trial and registered as new or previously below detection limit (15 mm3) were included. A multivariate logistic regression analysis with lung cancer as outcome was performed, including previously established volume cut-offs (<30 mm3, 30-<200 mm3 and 鈮200 mm3) and nodule characteristics (location, distribution, shape, margin and visibility <15 mm3 in retrospect).
Results: Overall, 1280 new nodules were included with 73 (6%) being lung cancer. Of nodules 鈮30 mm3 at detection and visible <15 mm3 in retrospect, 22% (6/27) were lung cancer. Discrimination based on volume cut-offs (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.80, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.84) and continuous volume (AUC: 0.82, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.87) was similar. After adjustment for volume cut-offs, only location in the right upper lobe (OR 2.0, P=0.012), central distribution (OR 2.4, P=0.001) and visibility <15 mm3 in retrospect (OR 4.7, P=0.003) remained significant predictors for lung cancer. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test (P=0.75) and assessment of bootstrap calibration curves indicated adequate model fit. Discrimination based on the continuous model probability (AUC: 0.85, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.89) was superior to volume cut-offs alone, but when stratified into three risk groups (AUC: 0.82, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.86), discrimination was similar.

However, subjects selected for screening based on demographic criteria typically have less than a 10% lifetime risk for lung cancer. Thus, there is need for a biomarker that better stratifies subjects for LDCT screening. Toward this goal, we previously reported a lung cancer risk test (LCRT) biomarker comprising 14 genome-maintenance (GM) pathway genes measured in normal bronchial epithelial cells (NBEC) that accurately classified cancer (CA) from non-cancer (NC) subjects. The primary goal of the studies reported here was to optimize the LCRT biomarker for high specificity and ease of clinical implementation.
Methods: Targeted competitive multiplex PCR amplicon libraries were prepared for next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of transcript abundance at 68 sites among 33 GM target genes in NBEC specimens collected from a retrospective cohort of 120 subjects, including 61 CA cases and 59 NC controls. Genes were selected for analysis based on contribution to the previously reported LCRT biomarker and/or prior evidence for association with lung cancer risk. Linear discriminant analysis was used to identify the most accurate classifier suitable to stratify subjects for screening.
Results: After cross-validation, a model comprising expression values from 12 genes (CDKN1A, E2F1, ERCC1, ERCC4, ERCC5, GPX1, GSTP1, KEAP1, RB1, TP53, TP63, and XRCC1) and demographic factors age, gender, and pack-years smoking, had Receiver Operator Characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) of 0.975 (95% CI: 0.96-0.99). The overall classification accuracy was 93% (95% CI 88%-98%) with sensitivity 93.1%, specificity 92.9%, positive predictive value 93.1% and negative predictive value 93%. The ROC AUC for this classifier was significantly better (p < 0.0001) than the best model comprising demographic features alone.
Conclusions: The LCRT biomarker reported here displayed high accuracy and ease of implementation on a high throughput, quality-controlled targeted NGS platform. As such, it is optimized for clinical validation in specimens from the ongoing LCRT blinded prospective cohort study. Following validation, the biomarker is expected to have clinical utility by better stratifying subjects for annual lung cancer screening compared to current demographic criteria alone."

Methods: We did this single-arm, prospective study in eight centres across Canada. We recruited participants aged 50-75 years, who had smoked at some point in their life (ever-smokers), and who did not have a self-reported history of lung cancer. Participants had at least a 2% 6-year risk of lung cancer as estimated by the PanCan model, a precursor to the validated PLCOm2012 model. Risk variables in the model were age, smoking duration, pack-years, family history of lung cancer, education level, body-mass index, chest x-ray in the past 3 years, and history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Individuals were screened with low-dose CT at baseline (T0), and at 1 (T1) and 4 (T4) years post-baseline. The primary outcome of the study was incidence of lung cancer.

Findings: 7059 queries came into the study coordinating centre and were screened for PanCan risk. 15 were duplicates, so 7044 participants were considered for enrolment. Between Sept 24, 2008, and Dec 17, 2010, we recruited and enrolled 2537 eligible ever-smokers. After a median follow-up of 5路5 years (IQR 3路2-6路1), 172 lung cancers were diagnosed in 164 individuals (cumulative incidence 0路065 [95% CI 0路055-0路075], incidence rate 138路1 per 10 000 person-years [117路8-160路9]). There were ten interval lung cancers (6% of lung cancers and 6% of individuals with cancer): one diagnosed between T0 and T1, and nine between T1 and T4. Cumulative incidence was significantly higher than that observed in NLST (4路0%; p<0路0001). Compared with 593 (57%) of 1040 lung cancers observed in NLST, 133 (77%) of 172 lung cancers in the PanCan Study were early stage (I or II; p<0路0001).
Interpretation: The PanCan model was effective in identifying individuals who were subsequently diagnosed with early, potentially curable, lung cancer. The incidence of cancers detected and the proportion of early stage cancers in the screened population was higher than observed in previous studies. This approach should be considered for adoption in lung cancer screening programmes.

Materials and methods: A primary cohort of 1798 patients with pathologically confirmed solid SPNs after surgery was retrospectively studied at five institutions from January 2014 to December 2015. A nomogram based on independent prediction factors of malignant solid SPN was developed. Predictive performance also was evaluated using the calibration curve and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
Results: The mean age of the cohort was 58.9 卤 10.7 years. In univariate and multivariate analysis, age; history of cancer; the log base 10 transformations of serum carcinoembryonic antigen value; nodule diameter; the presence of spiculation, pleural indentation, and calcification remained the predictive factors of malignancy. A nomogram was developed, and the AUC value (0.85; 95%CI, 0.83-0.88) was significantly higher than other three models. The calibration cure showed optimal agreement between the malignant probability as predicted by nomogram and the actual probability.

We sought to develop and internally validate a model incorporating lung function using data from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study. Methods This analysis included 502,321 participants without a previous diagnosis of lung cancer, predominantly between 40 and 70 years of age. We used flexible parametric survival models to estimate the 2-year probability of lung cancer, accounting for the competing risk of death. Models included predictors previously shown to be associated with lung cancer risk, including sex, variables related to smoking history and nicotine addiction, medical history, family history of lung cancer, and lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]). Results During accumulated follow-up of 1,469,518 person-years, there were 738 lung cancer diagnoses. A model incorporating all predictors had excellent discrimination (concordance (c)-statistic [95% CI] = 0.85 [0.82 to 0.87]). Internal validation suggested that the model will discriminate well when applied to new data (optimism-corrected c-statistic = 0.84). The full model, including FEV1, also had modestly superior discriminatory power than one that was designed solely on the basis of questionnaire variables (c-statistic = 0.84 [0.82 to 0.86]; optimism-corrected c-statistic = 0.83; pFEV1 = 3.4 脳 10-13). The full model had better discrimination than standard lung cancer screening eligibility criteria (c-statistic = 0.66 [0.64 to 0.69]). Conclusion A risk prediction model that includes lung function has strong predictive ability, which could improve eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening programs."

There is an increase in the incidence of nonsmoking-related lung cancer in recent years. The purpose of the present study was to investigate multiple potential risk factors for nonsmoking-related lung cancer among Asian Ethnic Groups.
Methods: We used a propensity score-mated cohort analysis for this study. We retrospectively review the medical record of 1975 asymptomatic healthy subjects (40 ~ 80 years old) who voluntarily underwent low-dose chest CT from August 2013 to October 2014. Clinical information and nodule characteristics were recorded.
Results: A propensity score-mated cohort analysis was applied to adjust for potential bias and to create two comparable groups according to family history of lung cancer. For our primary analysis, we matched 392 pairs of subjects with family history of lung cancer and subjects without history. Logistic regression showed that female gender and a family history of lung cancer were the two most important predictor of lung cancer in the endemic area with high prevalence of nonsmoking-related lung cancer (OR = 11.199, 95% CI = 1.444-86.862; OR = 2.831, 95% CI = 1.000136-8.015). In addition, the number of nodules was higher in subjects with family history of lung cancer in comparison with subjects without family history of lung cancer (OR = 1.309, 95% CI = 1.066-1.607).
Conclusions: In conclusion, risk-based prediction model based on the family history of lung cancer and female gender can potentially improve efficiency of lung cancer screening programs in Taiwan."

Methods: Participants underwent a baseline scan, two annual incidence scans and further follow-up scans for the detected nodules. All SSNs underwent a minimum of 2 years of follow-up (unless resolved or resected). Risk of malignancy was estimated using the PanCan model; discrimination [area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC)] and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test) were assessed. The Mann-Whitney U-Wilcoxon test was used to compare estimated risk between groups.
Results: 70 SSNs were detected in 41 (16.0%) out of 256 total participants. Median follow-up period was 25.5 months (range 2.0-74.0 months). 29 (41.4%) SSNs were transient. Five (7.1%) SSNs were resected, all found to be Stage I lung adenocarcinoma, including one SSN stable in size for 3.0 years before growth was detected. The PanCan model had good discrimination for the 52 baseline SSNs (AUC = 0.89; 95% confidence interval 0.76-1); the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was non-significant (p = 0.27). Estimated risk was significantly higher in the baseline SSNs found to be cancer vs those not found to be cancer after 2-6 years of follow-up (p < 0.01).
Conclusion: Our findings support a long-term follow-up approach for screen-detected SSNs for 3 years or longer. The PanCan model appeared discriminatory and well calibrated in this cohort.
Advances in knowledge: The PanCan model may have utility in identifying low-risk SSNs which could be followed with less frequent CT scans."

We sought to increase the predictive value of germline variants by considering their cumulative effects in the context of biologic pathways.
Methods: For individuals in the Environment and Genetics in Lung Cancer Etiology study (1,815 cases/1,971 controls), we computed pathway-level susceptibility effects as the sum of relevant SNP variant alleles weighted by their log-additive effects from a separate lung cancer GWAS meta-analysis (7,766 cases/37,482 controls). Logistic regression models based on age, sex, smoking, genetic variants, and principal components of pathway effects and pathway-smoking interactions were trained and optimized in cross-validation and further tested on an independent dataset (556 cases/830 controls). We assessed prediction performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
Results: Compared with typical binomial prediction models that have epidemiologic predictors (AUC = 0.607) in addition to top GWAS variants (AUC = 0.617), our pathway-based smoking-interactive multinomial model significantly improved prediction performance in external validation (AUC = 0.656, P < 0.0001).
Conclusions: Our biologically informed approach demonstrated a larger increase in AUC over nongenetic counterpart models relative to previous approaches that incorporate variants.
Impact: This model is the first of its kind to evaluate lung cancer prediction using subtype-stratified genetic effects organized into pathways and interacted with smoking. We propose pathway-exposure interactions as a potentially powerful new contributor to risk inference. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(8); 1208-15. 漏2016 AACR."

However, selecting ever-smokers for screening using individualized lung cancer risk calculations may be more effective and efficient than current USPSTF recommendations.
Objective: Comparison of modeled outcomes from risk-based CT lung-screening strategies vs USPSTF recommendations.
Design, setting, and participants: Empirical risk models for lung cancer incidence and death in the absence of CT screening using data on ever-smokers from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO; 1993-2009) control group. Covariates included age; education; sex; race; smoking intensity, duration, and quit-years; body mass index; family history of lung cancer; and self-reported emphysema. Model validation in the chest radiography groups of the PLCO and the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST; 2002-2009), with additional validation of the death model in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; 1997-2001), a representative sample of the United States. Models were applied to US ever-smokers aged 50 to 80 years (NHIS 2010-2012) to estimate outcomes of risk-based selection for CT lung screening, assuming screening for all ever-smokers, yield the percent changes in lung cancer detection and death observed in the NLST.
Exposures: Annual CT lung screening for 3 years beginning at age 50 years.
Main outcomes and measures: For model validity: calibration (number of model-predicted cases divided by number of observed cases [estimated/observed]) and discrimination (area under curve [AUC]). For modeled screening outcomes: estimated number of screen-avertable lung cancer deaths and estimated screening effectiveness (number needed to screen [NNS] to prevent 1 lung cancer death).
Results: Lung cancer incidence and death risk models were well calibrated in PLCO and NLST. The lung cancer death model calibrated and discriminated well for US ever-smokers aged 50 to 80 years (NHIS 1997-2001: estimated/observed = 0.94 [95%CI, 0.84-1.05]; AUC, 0.78 [95%CI, 0.76-0.80]). Under USPSTF recommendations, the models estimated 9.0 million US ever-smokers would qualify for lung cancer screening and 46,488 (95% CI, 43,924-49,053) lung cancer deaths were estimated as screen-avertable over 5 years (estimated NNS, 194 [95% CI, 187-201]). In contrast, risk-based selection screening of the same number of ever-smokers (9.0 million) at highest 5-year lung cancer risk (鈮1.9%) was estimated to avert 20% more deaths (55,717 [95% CI, 53,033-58,400]) and was estimated to reduce the estimated NNS by 17% (NNS, 162 [95% CI, 157-166]).
Conclusions and relevance: Among a cohort of US ever-smokers aged 50 to 80 years, application of a risk-based model for CT screening for lung cancer compared with a model based on USPSTF recommendations was estimated to be associated with a greater number of lung cancer deaths prevented over 5 years, along with a lower NNS to prevent 1 lung cancer death."

However, this mortality benefit comes with a high rate of false-positive findings, which require further evaluation.
Objectives: To identify patient- and center-specific factors associated with having a pulmonary nodule on baseline LDCT, and to develop a prediction rule to help in shared decision making.
Methods: We identified individuals who underwent baseline LDCT screening as part of the National Lung Screening Trial. A positive screen was defined as a nodule 4 mm or greater in largest dimension. Using multiple logistic regression, we identified variables independently associated with having a positive screen.
Measurements and main results: Among the 26,004 patients with complete data who underwent baseline LDCT, 7,123 patients (27%) had a positive screen. In a multivariate analysis, older age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.03 per 1-year increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-1.04), female sex (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.01-1.14), white race (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.25-1.55), heavier smoking history (OR = 1.02 per 5 pack-years smoked over 30, 95% CI = 1.00-1.04), history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.01-1.17), being married (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.02-1.15), hard rock mining (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.04-1.89), and farm work (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.03-1.23) were independently associated with having a positive screen, whereas having a college degree (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.86-1.00) and abstinence from smoking (OR = 0.98 per year, 95% CI = 0.98-0.99) were associated with not having a positive screen. Patients enrolled at a site in an area highly endemic for histoplasma were 30% more likely to have a positive baseline LDCT screen (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.21-1.40). The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for the full model was 0.57 (0.56-0.58); including enrollment center as a random effect increased the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve to 0.65.
Conclusions: In the National Lung Screening Trial, both patient- and center-specific factors were associated with having a positive baseline screen. Although the model does not have sufficient accuracy to provide personalized risk estimates to guide shared decision making on an individual basis, it can nonetheless inform screening centers of the likelihood of further follow-up testing for their populations at large when allocating resources.

Results: We identified a panel of 24 microRNAs with optimum classification performance. The combination of these 24 microRNAs alone could discriminate lung cancer cases from non-cancer controls with an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.87-0.95). This classification improved to an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90-0.97) following addition of sex, age and smoking status to the model. Internal validation of the model suggests that the discriminatory power of the panel will be high when applied to independent samples with a corrected AUC of 0.78 for the 24-miRNA panel alone.
Conclusion: Our 24-microRNA predictor improves lung cancer prediction beyond that of known risk factors."

We evaluated a simple 4-factor model, the Pittsburgh Predictor, against two well-known, but more complicated models for predicting lung cancer risk.
Methods: Trained against outcomes observed in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), the Pittsburgh Predictor used four risk factors, duration of smoking, smoking status, smoking intensity, and age, to predict 6-year lung cancer incidence. After calibrating the Bach and PLCOM2012 models to outcomes observed in the low-dose computed tomography arm of the NLST, we compared model calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness (net benefit) in the NLST and Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study (PLuSS) populations.
Results: The Pittsburgh Predictor, Bach, and PLCOM2012 represented risk equally well, except for the tendency of PLCOM2012 to overestimate risk in subjects at highest risk. Relative to the Pittsburgh Predictor, Bach and PLCOM2012 increased the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve by 0.007-0.009 and 0.012-0.021 units, respectively, depending on study population. Across a clinically relevant span of 6-year lung cancer risk thresholds (0.01-0.05), Bach and PLCOM2012 increased net benefit by less than 0.1% in NLST and 0.3% in PLuSS.
Conclusion: In exchange for a small reduction in prediction accuracy, a simpler lung cancer risk prediction model may facilitate standardized procedures for advising and selecting patients with respect to lung cancer screening."

We evaluated the lung cancer-predictive performance of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these regions.
Methods: Lung cancer cases (N = 778) and controls (N = 1166) were genotyped for 77 SNPs located in GWAS-identified lung cancer susceptibility regions. Variable selection and model development used stepwise logistic regression and decision-tree analyses. In a subset nested in the Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study, change in area under the receiver operator characteristic curve and net reclassification improvement were used to compare predictions made by risk factor models with and without genetic variables.
Results: Variable selection and model development kept two SNPs in each of three GWAS regions, rs2736100 and rs7727912 in 5p15.33, rs805297 and rs1802127 in 6p21.33, and rs8034191 and rs12440014 in 15q25.1. The ratio of cases to controls was three times higher among subjects with a high-risk genotype in every one as opposed to none of the three GWAS regions (odds ratio, 3.14; 95% confidence interval, 2.02-4.88; adjusted for sex, age, and pack-years). Adding a three-level classified count of GWAS regions with high-risk genotypes to an age and smoking risk factor-only model improved lung cancer prediction by a small amount: area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, 0.725 versus 0.717 (p = 0.056); overall net reclassification improvement was 0.052 across low-, intermediate-, and high- 6-year lung cancer risk categories (<3.0%, 3.0%-4.9%, 鈮 5.0%).

We previously reported that the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay (CBMN) is a strong predictor of lung cancer risk. Here, we validate our findings in an independent external lung cancer population and test discriminatory power improvement of the Spitz risk prediction model upon extension with this biomarker.
Methods: A total of 1,506 participants were stratified into a test set of 995 (527 cases/468 controls) from MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) and a validation set of 511 (239 cases/272 controls) from Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA). An epidemiologic questionnaire was administered and genetic instability was assessed using the CBMN assay.
Results: Excellent concordance was observed between the two populations in levels and distribution of CBMN endpoints [binucleated-micronuclei (BN-MN), binucleated-nucleoplasmic bridges (BN-NPB)] with significantly higher mean BN-MN and BN-NPB values among cases (P < 0.0001). Extension of the Spitz model led to an overall improvement in the AUC (95% confidence intervals) from 0.61 (55.5-65.7) with epidemiologic variables to 0.92 (89.4-94.2) with addition of the BN-MN endpoint. The most dramatic improvement was observed with the never-smokers extended model followed by the former and current smokers.
Conclusions: The CBMN assay is a sensitive and specific predictor of lung cancer risk, and extension of the Spitz risk prediction model led to an AUC that may prove useful in population screening programs to identify the ""true"" high-risk individuals.
Impact: Identifying high-risk subgroups that would benefit from screening surveillance has immense public health significance."

We analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of a panel of peripheral blood markers in detecting non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Methods: 100 healthy donors and 100 patients with NSCLC were enrolled onto this study. Free circulating DNA, circulating mRNA expression of peptidylarginine deiminase type 4 (PAD4/PADI4), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP) and haptoglobin were evaluated using a Real-Time PCR-based method.
Results: Free circulating DNA, PADI4, PPBP and haptoglobin levels were significantly higher in NSCLC patients than in healthy donors (p<0.0001, p<0.0001, p=0.0002 and p=0.0001, respectively). The fitted logistic regression model demonstrated a significant direct association between marker expression and lung cancer risk. The odds ratios of individual markers were 6.93 (95% CI 4.15-11.58; p<0.0001) for free DNA, 6.99 (95% CI 3.75-13.03; p<0.0001) for PADI4, 2.85 (95% CI 1.71-4.75; p<0.0001) for PPBP and 1.16 (95% CI 1.01-1.33; p=0.031) for haptoglobin. Free DNA in combination with PPBP and PADI4 gave an area under the ROC curve of 0.93, 95% CI=0.90-0.97, with sensitivity and specificity over 90%.
Conclusions: Free circulating DNA analysis combined with PPBP and PADI4 expression determination appears to accurately discriminate between healthy donors and NSCLC patients.

The discovery set (477 self-designated African Americans cases, 366 controls matched on age, ethnicity, and gender) were from Houston, Texas. The external replication set (330 cases and 342 controls) was from the EXHALE study at Wayne State University.
Results: In discovery, 154 inflammation SNPs were significant (p < 0.05) on univariate analysis, as was one of the gene panel SNPs (rs308738 in REV1, p = 0.0013), and three GWAS hits, rs16969968 p = 0.0014 and rs10519203 p = 0.0003 in the 15q locus and rs2736100, in the HTERT locus, p = 0.0002.

We conducted a study to determine the independent predictive potential of pro-SFTPB in identifying individuals who are subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer.
Patients and methods: Pro-SFTPB levels were measured in 2,485 individuals, who enrolled onto the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer Study by using plasma sample collected at the baseline visit. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the predictive ability of pro-SFTPB in addition to known lung cancer risk factors. Calibration and discrimination were evaluated, the latter by an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). External validation was performed with samples collected in the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) participants using a case-control study design.
Results: Adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, personal history of cancer, family history of lung cancer, forced expiratory volume in one second percent predicted, average number of cigarettes smoked per day, and smoking duration, pro-SFTPB (log transformed) had an odds ratio of 2.220 (95% CI, 1.727 to 2.853; P < .001).

Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study (n = 526 lung cancer patients and n = 592 control subjects) within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Control subjects were matched to lung cancer case patients on age, sex, follow-up time (median = 2.9 years), randomization year, and smoking (pack-years and time since quitting). Serum levels of 77 inflammation markers were measured using a Luminex bead-based assay. Conditional logistic regression and weighted Cox models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and cumulative risks, respectively.
Results: Of 68 evaluable markers, 11 were statistically significantly associated with lung cancer risk (P trend across marker categories < .05), including acute-phase proteins (C-reactive protein [CRP], serum amyloid A [SAA]), proinflammatory cytokines (soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 [sTNFRII]), anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1 receptor antagonist [IL-1RA]), lymphoid differentiation cytokines (interleukin 7 [IL-7]), growth factors (transforming growth factor alpha [TGF-A]), and chemokines (epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78 [ENA 78/CXCL5], monokine induced by gamma interferon [MIG/CXCL9], B cell-attracting chemokine 1 [BCA-1/CXCL13], thymus activation regulated chemokine [TARC/CCL17], macrophage-derived chemokine [MDC/CCL22]). Elevated marker levels were associated with increased lung cancer risk, with odds ratios comparing the highest vs the lowest group ranging from 1.47 (IL-7) to 2.27 (CRP). For IL-1RA, elevated levels were associated with decreased lung cancer risk (OR = 0.71; 95% confidence interval = 0.51 to 1.00). Associations did not differ by smoking, lung cancer histology, or latency. A cross-validated inflammation score using four independent markers (CRP, BCA-1/CXCL13, MDC/CCL22, and IL-1RA) provided good separation in 10-year lung cancer cumulative risks among former smokers (quartile [Q] 1 = 1.1% vs Q4 = 3.1%) and current smokers (Q1 = 2.3% vs Q4 = 7.9%) even after adjustment for smoking.

The objective of the present study was to develop an individualized risk prediction model for lung cancer in Korean men using population-based cohort data.
Methods: From a population-based cohort study of 1,324,804 Korean men free of cancer at baseline, the individualized absolute risk of developing lung cancer was estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. We checked the validity of the model using C statistics and the Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square test on an external validation dataset.
Results: The risk prediction model for lung cancer in Korean men included smoking exposure, age at smoking initiation, body mass index, physical activity, and fasting glucose levels. The model showed excellent performance (C statistic = 0.871, 95% CI = 0.867-0.876). Smoking was significantly associated with the risk of lung cancer in Korean men, with a four-fold increased risk in current smokers consuming more than one pack a day relative to non-smokers. Age at smoking initiation was also a significant predictor for developing lung cancer; a younger age at initiation was associated with a higher risk of developing lung cancer.
Conclusion: This is the first study to provide an individualized risk prediction model for lung cancer in an Asian population with very good model performance. In addition to current smoking status, earlier exposure to smoking was a very important factor for developing lung cancer. Since most of the risk factors are modifiable, this model can be used to identify those who are at a higher risk and who can subsequently modify their lifestyle choices to lower their risk of lung cancer."

We conducted a population-based prospective study to determine factors predicting the probability that lung nodules detected on the first screening low-dose CT scans are malignant or will be found to be malignant on follow-up.
Methods: We analyzed data from two cohorts of participants undergoing low-dose CT screening. The development data set included participants in the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer Study (PanCan). The validation data set included participants involved in chemoprevention trials at the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA), sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute. The final outcomes of all nodules of any size that were detected on baseline low-dose CT scans were tracked. Parsimonious and fuller multivariable logistic-regression models were prepared to estimate the probability of lung cancer.
Results: In the PanCan data set, 1871 persons had 7008 nodules, of which 102 were malignant, and in the BCCA data set, 1090 persons had 5021 nodules, of which 42 were malignant. Among persons with nodules, the rates of cancer in the two data sets were 5.5% and 3.7%, respectively. Predictors of cancer in the model included older age, female sex, family history of lung cancer, emphysema, larger nodule size, location of the nodule in the upper lobe, part-solid nodule type, lower nodule count, and spiculation. Our final parsimonious and full models showed excellent discrimination and calibration, with areas under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve of more than 0.90, even for nodules that were 10 mm or smaller in the validation set.
Conclusions: Predictive tools based on patient and nodule characteristics can be used to accurately estimate the probability that lung nodules detected on baseline screening low-dose CT scans are malignant.

To aid earlier detection, the socio-demographic and early clinical features predictive of lung cancer need to be identified.
Methods: We studied 12,074 cases of lung cancer and 120,731 controls in a large general practice database. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify the socio-demographic and clinical features associated with cancer up to 2 years before diagnosis. A risk prediction model was developed using variables that were independently associated with lung cancer up to 4 months before diagnosis. The model performance was assessed in an independent dataset of 1,826,293 patients from the same database. Discrimination was assessed by means of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
Results: Clinical and socio-demographic features that were independently associated with lung cancer were patients' age, sex, socioeconomic status and smoking history. From 4 to 12 months before diagnosis, the frequency of consultations and symptom records of cough, haemoptysis, dyspnoea, weight loss, lower respiratory tract infections, non-specific chest infections, chest pain, hoarseness, upper respiratory tract infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were also independently predictive of lung cancer. On validation, the model performed well with an area under the ROC curve of 0.88.
Conclusions: This new model performed substantially better than the current National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence referral guidelines and all comparable models. It has the potential to predict lung cancer cases sufficiently early to make detection at a curable stage more likely by allowing general practitioners to better risk stratify their patients. A clinical trial is needed to quantify the absolute benefits to patients and the cost effectiveness of this model in practice."

Serum sHER2 concentrations were measured by immunoassay in 244 primary NSCLC cases and 218 healthy controls. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, logistic regression models, and receiver operating characteristic plots were used to assess whether sHER2 is associated with lung cancer. Median serum sHER2 concentrations are higher in patients with adenocarcinoma than squamous cell carcinoma regardless of gender, and sHER2 is a weak, independent biomarker of adenocarcinoma, but not of squamous cell carcinoma, adjusted for age and gender. The age-adjusted relative risk (odds) of adenocarcinoma is 3.95 (95% CI: 1.22, 12.81) and 7.93 (95% CI: 2.26, 27.82) greater for women and men with high sHER2 concentrations (鈮6.60 ng/mL) vs. low sHER2 concentrations (鈮1.85 ng/mL), respectively. When adjusted for each other, sHER2, age, and gender discern healthy controls from patients with primary adenocarcinomas of the lung with 85.9% accuracy.

There are no validated techniques for an early detection of pulmonary cancer lesions other than low-dose helical computed tomography scan. Unfortunately, this method has some negative effects. Recent studies have laid the basis for development of exosomes-based techniques to screen/diagnose lung cancers. As the isolation of circulating exosomes is a minimally invasive procedure, this technique opens new possibilities for diagnostic applications.
Methods: We used a first set of 30 plasma samples from as many patients, including 10 patients affected by lung adenocarcinomas, 10 with lung granulomas, and 10 healthy smokers matched for age and sex as negative controls. Wide-range microRNAs analysis (742 microRNAs) was performed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. Data were compared on the basis of lesion characteristics, using WEKA software for statistics and modeling. Subsequently, selected microRNAs were evaluated on an independent larger group of samples (105 specimens: 50 lung adenocarcinomas, 30 lung granulomas, and 25 healthy smokers).
Results: This analysis led to the selection of four microRNAs to perform a screening test (miR-378a, miR-379, miR-139-5p, and miR-200b-5p), useful to divide population into two groups: nodule (lung adenocarcinomas + carcinomas) and non-nodule (healthy former smokers). Six microRNAs (miR-151a-5p, miR-30a-3p, miR-200b-5p, miR-629, miR-100, and miR-154-3p) were selected for a second test on the nodule population to discriminate between lung adenocarcinoma and granuloma.
Conclusions: The screening test showed 97.5% sensitivity, 72.0% specificity, and area under the curve receiver operating characteristic of 90.8%. The diagnostic test had 96.0% sensitivity, 60.0% specificity, and area under the curve receiver operating characteristic of 76.0%.

There are no validated techniques for an early detection of pulmonary cancer lesions other than low-dose helical computed tomography scan. Unfortunately, this method has some negative effects. Recent studies have laid the basis for development of exosomes-based techniques to screen/diagnose lung cancers. As the isolation of circulating exosomes is a minimally invasive procedure, this technique opens new possibilities for diagnostic applications.
Methods: We used a first set of 30 plasma samples from as many patients, including 10 patients affected by lung adenocarcinomas, 10 with lung granulomas, and 10 healthy smokers matched for age and sex as negative controls. Wide-range microRNAs analysis (742 microRNAs) was performed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. Data were compared on the basis of lesion characteristics, using WEKA software for statistics and modeling. Subsequently, selected microRNAs were evaluated on an independent larger group of samples (105 specimens: 50 lung adenocarcinomas, 30 lung granulomas, and 25 healthy smokers).

We build separate risk models for current and former smokers using 169,035 ever smokers from the multicenter European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and considered a model for never smokers. The data set was split into independent training and test sets. Lung cancer incidence was modeled using survival analysis, stratifying by age started smoking, and for former smokers, also smoking duration. Other risk factors considered were smoking intensity, 10 occupational/environmental exposures previously implicated with lung cancer, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms at two loci identified by genome-wide association studies of lung cancer. Individual risk in the test set was measured by the predicted probability of lung cancer incidence in the year preceding last follow-up time, predictive accuracy was measured by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Using smoking information alone gave good predictive accuracy: the AUC and 95% confidence interval in ever smokers was 0.843 (0.810-0.875), the Bach model applied to the same data gave an AUC of 0.775 (0.737-0.813). Other risk factors had negligible effect on the AUC, including never smokers for whom prediction was poor. Our model is generalizable and straightforward to implement. Its accuracy can be attributed to its modeling of lifetime exposure to smoking."

Methods: Associations between serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8) levels and lung cancer were analyzed among 270 case patients and 296 control subjects participating in the National Cancer Institute-Maryland (NCI-MD) case-control study. Results were validated in 532 case patients and 595 control subjects in a nested case-control study within the prospective Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Association with C-reactive protein (CRP), a systemic inflammation biomarker, was also analyzed. Associations between biomarkers and lung cancer were estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for smoking, stage, histology, age, and sex. The 10-year standardized absolute risks of lung cancer were estimated using a weighted Cox regression model.
Results: Serum IL-6 and IL-8 levels in the highest quartile were associated with lung cancer in the NCI-MD study (IL-6, odds ratio [OR] = 3.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.88 to 5.77; IL-8, OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.19 to 3.57) and with lung cancer risk in the PLCO study (IL-6, OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.04 to 2.10; IL-8, OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.10 to 2.24), compared with the lowest quartile. In the PLCO study, increased IL-6 levels were only associated with lung cancer diagnosed within 2 years of blood collection, whereas increased IL-8 levels were associated with lung cancer diagnosed more than 2 years after blood collection (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.15 to 2.13). The 10-year standardized absolute risks of lung cancer in the PLCO study were highest among current smokers with high IL-8 and CRP levels (absolute risk = 8.01%, 95% CI = 5.77% to 11.05%).

We developed two models to stratify individual smokers according to risk of developing lung cancer. We first used the number of lung cancers detected at baseline screening CT in the 5,203 asymptomatic participants of the COSMOS trial to recalibrate the Bach model, which we propose using to select smokers for screening. Next, we incorporated lung nodule characteristics and presence of emphysema identified at baseline CT into the Bach model and proposed the resulting multivariable model to predict lung cancer risk in screened smokers after baseline CT. Age and smoking exposure were the main determinants of lung cancer risk. The recalibrated Bach model accurately predicted lung cancers detected during the first year of screening. Presence of nonsolid nodules (RR = 10.1, 95% CI = 5.57-18.5), nodule size more than 8 mm (RR = 9.89, 95% CI = 5.84-16.8), and emphysema (RR = 2.36, 95% CI = 1.59-3.49) at baseline CT were all significant predictors of subsequent lung cancers. Incorporation of these variables into the Bach model increased the predictive value of the multivariable model (c-index = 0.759, internal validation). The recalibrated Bach model seems suitable for selecting the higher risk population for recruitment for large-scale CT screening. The Bach model incorporating CT findings at baseline screening could help defining the time interval to subsequent screening in individual participants.

In this article, we quantify the improvement in risk prediction with addition of SEZ6L to the LLP risk model. Data from 388 LLP subjects genotyped for SEZ6L single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) were combined with epidemiologic risk factors. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to predict 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer with and without this SNP. The improvement in the model associated with the SEZ6L SNP was assessed through pairwise comparison of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the net reclassification improvements (NRI). The extended model showed better calibration compared with the baseline model. There was a statistically significant modest increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve when SEZ6L was added into the baseline model. The NRI also revealed a statistically significant improvement of around 12% for the extended model; this improvement was better for subjects classified into the two intermediate-risk categories by the baseline model (NRI, 27%). Our results suggest that the addition of SEZ6L improved the performance of the LLP risk model, particularly for subjects whose initial absolute risks were unable to discriminate into ""low-risk"" or ""high-risk"" group.

Methods: The amino-acid concentrations in venous blood samples from pre-treatment NSCLC patients (n = 141), and age-matched, gender-matched, and smoking status-matched controls (n = 423), were measured using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The resultant study data set was subjected to multiple logistic regression analysis to identify amino acids related with NSCLC and construct the criteria for discriminating NSCLC patients from controls. A test data set derived from 162 patients and 3,917 controls was used to validate the stability of the constructed criteria.
Results: The plasma amino-acid profiles significantly differed between the NSCLC patients and the controls.

We used a novel strategy that allows discovery of differentially present proteins against a complex and variable background.
Methods: Mass spectrometry analyses of paired pulmonary venous-radial arterial blood from 16 lung cancer patients were applied to identify plasma proteins potentially derived from the tumor microenvironment. Two differentially expressed proteins were confirmed in 64 paired venous-arterial blood samples using an immunoassay. Twenty-eight pre- and postsurgical resection peripheral blood samples and two independent, blinded sets of plasma from 149 participants in a lung cancer screening study (49 lung cancers and 100 controls) and 266 participants from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Lung Health Study (45 lung cancer and 221 matched controls) determined the accuracy of the two protein markers to detect subclinical lung cancer.
Results: Connective tissue-activating peptide III (CTAP III)/ neutrophil activating protein-2 (NAP-2) and haptoglobin were identified to be significantly higher in venous than in arterial blood. CTAP III/NAP-2 levels decreased after tumor resection (P = .01). In two independent population cohorts, CTAP III/NAP-2 was significantly associated with lung cancer and improved the accuracy of a lung cancer risk prediction model that included age, smoking, lung function (FEV(1)), and an interaction term between FEV(1) and CTAP III/NAP-2 (area under the curve, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.91) compared to CAPIII/NAP-2 alone.

We have published an internally validated prediction tool for lung cancer based on easily obtainable epidemiologic and clinical data. Because the precision of the model was modest, we now estimate the improvement obtained by adding two markers of DNA repair capacity. Assay data (host-cell reactivation and mutagen sensitivity) were available for 725 White lung cancer cases and 615 controls, all former or current smokers, a subset of cases and controls from the previous analysis. Multivariable models were constructed from the original variables with addition of the biomarkers separately and together. Pairwise comparisons of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and 3-fold cross-validations were done. For former smokers, the AUC and 95% confidence intervals were 0.67 (0.63-0.71) for the baseline model and 0.70 (0.66-0.74) for the expanded model. For current smokers, the comparable AUC values were 0.68 (0.64-0.72) and 0.73 (0.69-0.77). For both groups, the expanded models were statistically significantly better than the baseline models (P = 0.006 and P = 0.0048, respectively), although the increases in the concordance statistics were modest. We also recomputed 1-year absolute risks of lung cancer as described previously for two different risk profiles and showed that individuals who exhibited poor repair capacity or heightened mutagen sensitivity had increased absolute risks of lung cancer. Addition of biomarker assays improved the sensitivity of the expanded models."

Protein peak identification and clustering were performed using the Biomarker Wizard software. Proteomic spectra of serum samples from 89 lung cancer patients and age- and sex-matched 68 healthy individuals were used as a training set and a classification tree with 3 distinct protein masses was generated by using Biomarker Pattern software. The validity of the classification tree was then challenged with a blind test set including another 62 lung cancer patients and 34 healthy individuals. We additionally determined Cyfra21-1 and carcinoembryonic antigen in all the serum samples included in this study using an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay.
Results: The software identified an average of 48 mass peaks/spectrum and 3 of the identified peaks at 5808, 5971, and 7779 d were used to construct the classification tree. The classification tree separated effectively lung cancer from healthy individuals, achieving a sensitivity of 91% (81 of 89) and a specificity of 97% (66 of 68). The blind test challenged the model with a sensitivity of 89% (55 of 62) and a specificity of 91% (31 of 34), and a positive predictive value of 90% (86 of 96), respectively. The specificity of Cyfra21-1 and the sensitivity provided by Cyfra21-1 and carcinoembryonic antigen used individually or in combination were significantly lower than that of the SELDI marker pattern (P < 0.05 or P < 0.005, respectively).
Conclusion: The results suggest that SELDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry technique can correctly distinguish lung cancer patients from healthy individuals and shows great potential for the development of a screening test for the detection of lung cancer."

Therefore, a need exists to construct and validate a risk prediction model for lung cancer that is specific to African-Americans. We analyzed data from 491 African-Americans with lung cancer and 497 matched African-American controls to identify specific risks and incorporate them into a multivariable risk model for lung cancer and estimate the 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer. We performed internal and external validations of the risk model using data on additional cases and controls from the same ongoing multiracial/ethnic lung cancer case-control study from which the model-building data were obtained as well as data from two different lung cancer studies in metropolitan Detroit, respectively. We also compared our African-American model with our previously developed risk prediction model for whites. The final risk model included smoking-related variables [smoking status, pack-years smoked, age at smoking cessation (former smokers), and number of years since smoking cessation (former smokers)], self-reported physician diagnoses of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or hay fever, and exposures to asbestos or wood dusts. Our risk prediction model for African-Americans exhibited good discrimination [75% (95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.82)] for our internal data and moderate discrimination [63% (95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.69)] for the external data group, which is an improvement over the Spitz model for white subjects. Existing lung cancer prediction models may not be appropriate for predicting risk for African-Americans because (a) they were developed using white populations, (b) level of risk is different for risk factors that African-American share with whites, and (c) unique group-specific risk factors exist for African-Americans. This study developed and validated a risk prediction model for lung cancer that is specific to African-Americans and thus more precise in predicting their risks.

Significant risk factors were fitted into multivariate conditional logistic regression models. The final multivariate model was combined with age-standardised lung cancer incidence data to calculate absolute risk estimates. Combinations of lifestyle risk factors were modelled to create risk profiles. For example, a 77-year-old male non-smoker, with a family history of lung cancer (early onset) and occupational exposure to asbestos has an absolute risk of 3.17% (95% CI, 1.67-5.95). Choosing a 2.5% cutoff to trigger increased surveillance, gave a sensitivity of 0.62 and specificity of 0.70, while a 6.0% cutoff gave a sensitivity of 0.34 and specificity of 0.90.

We constructed and validated a comprehensive clinical tool for lung cancer risk prediction by smoking status.
Methods: Epidemiologic data from 1851 lung cancer patients and 2001 matched control subjects were randomly divided into separate training (75% of the data) and validation (25% of the data) sets for never, former, and current smokers, and multivariable models were constructed from the training sets. The discriminatory ability of the models was assessed in the validation sets by examining the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves and with concordance statistics. Absolute 1-year risks of lung cancer were computed using national incidence and mortality data. An ordinal risk index was constructed for each smoking status category by summing the odds ratios from the multivariable regression analyses for each risk factor.
Results: All variables that had a statistically significant association with lung cancer (environmental tobacco smoke, family history of cancer, dust exposure, prior respiratory disease, and smoking history variables) have strong biologically plausible etiologic roles in the disease. The concordance statistics in the validation sets for the never, former, and current smoker models were 0.57, 0.63, and 0.58, respectively. The computed 1-year absolute risk of lung cancer for a hypothetical male current smoker with an estimated relative risk close to 9 was 8.68%. The ordinal risk index performed well in that true-positive rates in the designated high-risk categories were 69% and 70% for current and former smokers, respectively.
Conclusions: If confirmed in other studies, this risk assessment procedure could use easily obtained clinical information to identify individuals who may benefit from increased screening surveillance for lung cancer. Although the concordance statistics were modest, they are consistent with those from other risk prediction models."

Results: The most parsimonious model included the effects of BRCA1/2 mutations, and the residual familial aggregation was accounted for by a polygenic component (SD 1.43, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.86), reflecting the multiplicative effects of a large number of genes with small contributions to the familial risk. We estimated that 1 in 630 individuals carries a BRCA1 mutation and 1 in 195 carries a BRCA2 mutation. We extended this model to incorporate the explicit effects of 17 common alleles that are associated with OvC risk. Based on our models, assuming all of the susceptibility genes could be identified we estimate that the half of the female population at highest genetic risk will account for 92% of all OvCs.
Conclusions: The resulting model can be used to obtain the risk of developing OvC on the basis of BRCA1/2, explicit family history and common alleles. This is the first model that accounts for all OvC familial aggregation and would be useful in the OvC genetic counselling process."

Early stage ovarian cancer is usually asymptomatic, therefore, is often first diagnosed when it is widely disseminated. Currently available diagnostics lack the requisite sensitivity and specificity to be implemented as community-based screening tests. The identification of additional biomarkers may improve the diagnostic efficiency of multivariate index assays. The aims of this study were to characterise and compare the ovarian tissue immunohistochemical localisation and plasma concentrations of three putative ovarian cancer biomarkers: human cationic antimicrobial protein-18 (hCAP-18); lactoferrin; and CD163 in normal healthy women and women with ovarian cancer.
Methods: In this case-control cohort study, ovarian tissue and blood samples were obtained from 164 women (73 controls, including 28 women with benign pelvic masses; 91 cancer, including 21 women with borderline tumours). Localisation of each antigen within the ovary was assessed by immunohistochemistry and serum concentrations determined by ELISA assays.
Results: Immunoreactive (ir) hCAP-18 and lactoferrin were identified in epithelial cells, while CD163 was predominately localised in stromal cells. Tissue ir CD163 increased significantly (P<0.05) with disease grade. Median plasma concentrations of soluble (s)CD163 were significantly greater in the cases (3220 ng/ml) than in controls (2488 ng/ml) (P< 0.01). Median plasma concentrations of hCAP-18 and lactoferrin were not significantly different between cases and controls. The classification efficiency of each biomarker (as determined by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve; AUC) was: 0.67卤 0.04; 0.62 卤 0.08 and 0.51 卤 0.07 for sCD163, hCAP-18 and lactoferrin, respectively. When the 3 biomarkers were modelled using stochastic gradient boosted logistic regression, the AUC increased to 0.95 卤 0.03.

A multiple logistic regression model was developed to evaluate CA-125 velocity and other related covariates as predictors of ovarian cancer. Predictive accuracy was assessed by the concordance index and measures of discrimination and calibration while the fit of the model was assessed by the Hosmer and Lemeshow's goodness-of-fit 蠂(2)test.
Results: CA-125 velocity decreased as the number of CA-125 measurements increased but was unaffected by age at baseline screen and family history of ovarian cancer.

Concentrations of leptin, prolactin, osteopontin, insulin-like growth factor II, macrophage inhibitory factor, and CA-125 were determined using a multiplex, bead-based, immunoassay system. All six markers were evaluated in a training set (181 samples from the control group and 113 samples from OC patients) and a test set (181 sample control group and 43 ovarian cancer).
Results: Multiplex and ELISA exhibited the same pattern of expression for all the biomarkers. None of the biomarkers by themselves were good enough to differentiate healthy versus cancer cells.

Recent information suggests that the incidence of detectable prostate cancer is similar in men whose PSA values range from 2.5 to 4.0 ng/mL and from 4.0 to 10.0 ng/mL. If the PSA threshold triggering a prostate biopsy is lowered to 2.5 ng/mL, approximately 13% of men older than 50 would be added to the patient biopsy pool.
Methods: One hundred fifty-one men were enrolled in a prospective, Institutional Review Board-approved protocol to evaluate the incidence of cancer in a population of men who participated in an early-detection program and whose PSA level was between 2.5 and 4.0 ng/mL. All the men underwent biopsy using an 11-core multisite-directed biopsy scheme, and all biopsy specimens were examined by one pathologist. All men had a second blood specimen drawn before the biopsy for a determination of serum PSA, creatinine kinase, prostatic acid phosphatase, and fPSA. A new neural network algorithm was developed with PSA, creatinine kinase, prostatic acid phosphatase, fPSA, and age as input variables to produce a single-valued prostate cancer detection index (PCD-I). This new algorithm was then prospectively tested in the 151 men. Performance parameters (including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and biopsies saved) were calculated, and a comparative analysis was performed to evaluate the differences among the new algorithm, percent fPSA, PSA density, and PSA density-transition zone.
Results: Cancer was histologically confirmed in 24.5% (37 of 151) of the men. The median age of the men was 62 years (range 43 to 74). At a sensitivity of 92%, the specificity for percent fPSA was 11%. The new algorithm (PCD-I) demonstrated an additional enhancement of specificity to 62% at 92% sensitivity. Clinically, the PCD-I would result in a savings of 49% (74 of 151) of all biopsies or 63.6% (71 of 114) of all unnecessary biopsies.
Conclusions: A new generation algorithm, derived from a neural network (PCD-I) incorporating the parameters of age, creatinine kinase, PSA, prostatic acid phosphatase, and fPSA can significantly enhance the specificity and reduce the number of biopsies while maintaining a 92% sensitivity rate."

If updated into the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC Rotterdam) risk calculator number 3 (RC3), this may further improve upfront selection of men who need a biopsy.
Objective: To improve the number of possible biopsies avoided, while limiting undiagnosed clinically important PCa by applying the updated RC3 for risk-based patient selection.
Design, setting, and participants: The RC3 is based on the first screening round of the ERSPC Rotterdam, which involved 3616 men. In 2015, histopathologic slides for PCa cases (n=885) were re-evaluated. Low-risk (LR) PCa was defined as ISUP grade 1 or 2 without CR/IDC. High-risk (HR) PCa was defined as ISUP grade 2 with CR/IDC and PCa with ISUP grade鈮3.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: We updated the RC3 using multinomial logistic regression analysis, including data on age, PSA, digital rectal examination, and prostate volume, for predicting LR and HR PCa. Predictive accuracy was quantified using receiver operating characteristic analysis and decision curve analysis.
Results and limitations: Men without PCa could effectively be distinguished from men with LR PCa and HR PCa (area under the curve 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-0.72 and 0.92, 95% CI 0.90-0.94). At a 1% risk threshold, the updated calculator would lead to a 34% reduction in unnecessary biopsies, while only 2% of HR PCa cases would be undiagnosed.

In 2015, histopathologic slides for PCa cases (n=885) were re-evaluated. Low-risk (LR) PCa was defined as ISUP grade 1 or 2 without CR/IDC. High-risk (HR) PCa was defined as ISUP grade 2 with CR/IDC and PCa with ISUP grade鈮3.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: We updated the RC3 using multinomial logistic regression analysis, including data on age, PSA, digital rectal examination, and prostate volume, for predicting LR and HR PCa. Predictive accuracy was quantified using receiver operating characteristic analysis and decision curve analysis.
Results and limitations: Men without PCa could effectively be distinguished from men with LR PCa and HR PCa (area under the curve 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-0.72 and 0.92, 95% CI 0.90-0.94). At a 1% risk threshold, the updated calculator would lead to a 34% reduction in unnecessary biopsies, while only 2% of HR PCa cases would be undiagnosed.
Conclusions: A relatively simple risk stratification tool augmented with a highly sensitive contemporary pathologic biopsy classification would result in a considerable decrease in unnecessary prostate biopsies and overdiagnosis of potentially indolent disease.
Patient summary: We improved a well-known prostate risk calculator with a new pathology classification system that better reflects disease burden. This new risk calculator allows individualized prediction of the chance of having (potentially aggressive) biopsy-detectable prostate cancer and can guide shared decision-making when considering prostate biopsy."

In addition, KPCRC-HG was validated and compared with internet-based Western risk calculators in a validation cohort.
Materials and methods: Using a logistic regression model, KPCRC-HG was developed based on the data from 602 previously unscreened Korean men who underwent initial prostate biopsies. Using 2,313 cases in a validation cohort, KPCRC-HG was compared with the European Randomized Study of Screening for PC Risk Calculator for high-grade cancer (ERSPCRC-HG) and the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator 2.0 for high-grade cancer (PCPTRC-HG). The predictive accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration plots.
Results: PC was detected in 172 (28.6%) men, 120 (19.9%) of whom had PC of Gleason score 7 or higher. Independent predictors included prostate-specific antigen levels, digital rectal examination findings, transrectal ultrasound findings, and prostate volume. The AUC of the KPCRC-HG (0.84) was higher than that of the PCPTRC-HG (0.79, p<0.001) but not different from that of the ERSPCRC-HG (0.83) on external validation. Calibration plots also revealed better performance of KPCRC-HG and ERSPCRC-HG than that of PCPTRC-HG on external validation. At a cut-off of 5% for KPCRC-HG, 253 of the 2,313 men (11%) would not have been biopsied, and 14 of the 614 PC cases with Gleason score 7 or higher (2%) would not have been diagnosed.
Conclusions: KPCRC-HG is the first web-based high-grade prostate cancer prediction model in Korea. It had higher predictive accuracy than PCPTRC-HG in a Korean population and showed similar performance with ERSPCRC-HG in a Korean population. This prediction model could help avoid unnecessary biopsy and reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment in clinical settings."

However, it is important to underline that PSA is not the ideal screening tool due to its low specificity, which leads to the possible biopsy for the patient without High-grade prostate cancer (HGPCa). Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish a predictive nomogram for HGPCa in patients with PSA 4-10 ng/ml based on Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS v2), MRI-based prostate volume (PV), MRI-based PV-adjusted Prostate Specific Antigen Density (adjusted-PSAD) and other traditional classical parameters.
Methods: Between January 2014 and September 2015, Of 151 men who were eligible for analysis were formed the training cohort. A prediction model for HGPCa was built by using backward logistic regression and was presented on a nomogram. The prediction model was evaluated by a validation cohort between October 2015 and October 2016 (n = 74). The relationship between the nomogram-based risk-score as well as other parameters with Gleason score (GS) was evaluated. All patients underwent 12-core systematic biopsy and at least one core targeted biopsy with transrectal ultrasonographic guidance.
Results: The multivariate analysis revealed that patient age, PI-RADS v2 score and adjusted-PSAD were independent predictors for HGPCa. Logistic regression (LR) model had a larger AUC as compared with other parameters alone. The most discriminative cutoff value for LR model was 0.36, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 87.3, 78.4, 76.3, and 90.4%, respectively and the diagnostic performance measures retained similar values in the validation cohort (AUC 0.82 [95% CI, 0.76-0.89]). For all patients with HGPCa (n = 50), adjusted-PSAD and nomogram-based risk-score were positively correlated with the GS of HGPCa in PSA gray zone (r = 0.455, P = 0.002 and r = 0.509, P = 0.001, respectively).
Conclusion: The nomogram based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) for forecasting HGPCa is effective, which could reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies in patients with PSA 4-10 ng/ml and nomogram-based risk-score could provide a more robust parameter of assessing the aggressiveness of HGPCa in PSA gray zone."

Patients and methods: Serum isolated from 250 men from three tertiary referral centres with pre-biopsy blood draws was analysed for total prostate-specific antigen (PSA), free PSA (fPSA) and p2PSA. From this, the Prostate Health Index (PHI) score was calculated (PHI = (p2PSA/fPSA)*鈭歵PSA). The men's clinical information was used to derive their risk according to the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) risk model. Two clinical prediction models were created via multivariable regression consisting of age, family history, abnormality on digital rectal examination, previous negative biopsy and either PSA or PHI score, respectively. Calibration plots, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision curves were generated to assess the performance of the three models.
Results: The PSA model and PHI model were both well calibrated in this cohort, with the PHI model showing the best correlation between predicted probabilities and actual outcome. The areas under the ROC curve for the PHI model, PSA model and PCPT model were 0.77, 0.71 and 0.69, respectively, for the prediction of prostate cancer (PCa) and 0.79, 0.72 and 0.72, respectively, for the prediction of high grade PCa. Decision-curve analysis showed a superior net benefit of the PHI model over both the PSA model and the PCPT risk model in the diagnosis of PCa and high grade PCa over the entire range of risk probabilities.
Conclusion: A logical and standardized approach to the use of clinical risk factors can allow more accurate risk stratification of men under investigation for PCa. The measurement of p2PSA and the integration of this biomarker into a clinical prediction model can further increase the accuracy of risk stratification, helping to better inform the decision for prostate biopsy in a referral population."

Objective: To externally validate a previously developed Prostate Health Index (PHI)-based nomogram for predicting the presence of prostate cancer (PCa) at biopsy.
Design, setting, and participants: The study population consisted of 883 patients who were scheduled for a prostate biopsy at one of five European tertiary care centers. Total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA), free prostate-specific antigen (fPSA), and [-2]pro-prostate-specific antigen (p2PSA) levels were determined. The fPSA-to-tPSA ratio (%fPSA), p2PSA, and PHI ([p2PSA / fPSA] 脳 鈭歵PSA) were calculated.
Intervention: Extended initial and repeat prostate biopsy.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Logistic regression models were fitted to test the predictors of PCa and to determine their predictive accuracy. A calibration plot was used to evaluate the extent of overestimation or underestimation between nomogram predictions and observed PCa rate. Decision curve analysis (DCA) provided an estimate of the net benefit obtained by using the PHI-based nomogram.
Results and limitations: Of 833 patients, 365 (41.3%) were diagnosed with PCa at extended prostate biopsy. In accuracy analyses, PHI was the most informative predictor of PCa (0.68), outperforming tPSA (0.51) and %fPSA (0.64). The predictive accuracy of the previously developed nomogram was 75.2% (95% confidence interval, 71.4-78.1). Calibration of the nomogram was good in patients at a low to intermediate predicted probability of PCa, while calibration was suboptimal, with a tendency to overestimate the presence of PCa, in high-risk patients. Finally, DCA demonstrated that the use of the PHI-based nomogram resulted in the highest net benefit. The main limitation of the study is the fact that only Caucasian patients were included.
Conclusions: At external validation, the previously developed PHI-based nomogram confirmed its ability to determine the presence of PCa at biopsy. These findings provide further evidence supporting the potential role of the nomogram in the biopsy decision pathway for European men with suspected PCa.
Patient summary: In the current study, we externally validated a Prostate Health Index-based nomogram to predict the presence of prostate cancer (PCa) at biopsy. This tool may help clinicians determine the need for a prostate biopsy in European patients with suspected PCa."

Methods: A total of 1104 patients who had undergone trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided 12 + 1-core prostate biopsy were retrospectively evaluated in the first stage of the study. Age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the free/total PSA ratio (f/t), digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, the presence of a hypoechoic mass revealed using ultrasound, ultrasonic detection of microcalcifications, prostate volume (PV) and PSA density were considered as predictive factors. Multiple logistic regression analysis involving a backward elimination selection procedure was used to select independent predictors. We compared positive rates regarding 6-core and 12-core biopsy schemes at different risk levels. In the second stage of the study, 238 cases were evaluated using our nomogram. In higher risk patients, we employed a 6 + 1 core biopsy. Positive rates in the first and second stages of the study were compared.
Results: Age, the baseline median natural logarithm of PSA (Ln[PSA]), Ln(PV), f/t, rate of abnormal DRE findings and rate of hypoechoic masses detected using TRUS were the factors that were finally submitted into our nomogram. A significantly greater area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was obtained for the nomogram than for PSA level alone (0.853 vs. 0.761). A cancer probability cutoff value of 0.5 suggested no significant difference between the 6-core and 12-core biopsy schemes at higher risk levels. In the second stage of the study we verified that in patients with a cancer probability cutoff value >0.5, a 6 + 1-core biopsy could be used without a reduction in the positive detection rate, and significantly reducing the number of biopsy cores required.
Conclusions: A nomogram based on data from Chinese males was developed to predict the positive detection rate, ratio of positive cores and Gleason score at each risk level.

For individual BCR prediction at any given time after operation, additional ANN, and LR models were calculated every 6 months for up to 7.5 years of follow-up. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for the ANN (0.754) and LR models (0.755) calculated immediately following LRP, were larger than that for GS (AUC: 0.715; P = 0.0015 and 0.001), pT or PSA (AUC: 0.619; P always <0.0001) alone. The GS predicted the BCR better than PSA (P = 0.0001), but there was no difference between the ANN and LR models (P = 0.39). Our ANN and LR models predicted individual BCR risk from radical prostatectomy for up to 10 years postoperative. ANN and LR models equally and significantly improved the prediction of BCR compared with PSA and GS alone. When the GS and ANN output values are combined, a more accurate BCR prediction is possible, especially in high-risk patients with GS 鈮7."

This study aimed to evaluate whether published SNPs improve the performance of a clinical risk-calculator in predicting prostate biopsy result.
Methods: Three hundred forty-six patients with a previous prostate biopsy (191 positive, 155 negative) were enrolled. After literature search, nine SNPs were selected for their statistically significant association with increased PCa risk. Allelic odds ratios were computed and a new logistic regression model was built integrating the clinical risk score (i.e., prior biopsy results, PSA level, prostate volume, transrectal ultrasound, and digital rectal examination) and a multilocus genetic risk score (MGRS). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC) of the clinical score alone versus the integrated clinic-genetic model were compared. The added value of the MGRS was assessed using the Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) and Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI) statistics.
Results: Predictive performance of the integrated clinico-genetic model (AUC = 0.781) was slightly higher than predictive performance of the clinical score alone (AUC = 0.770). The prediction of PCa was significantly improved with an IDI of 0.015 (P-value = 0.035) and a continuous NRI of 0.403 (P-value < 0.001).
Conclusions: The predictive performance of the clinical model was only slightly improved by adding MGRS questioning the real clinical added value with regards to the cost of genetic testing and performance of current inexpensive clinical risk-calculators."

A new model is developed with only two explanatory variables and a simple graphical output.
Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study based on data collected from December 2006 to June 2011 at the Clinic of Urology of the University Hospital in Olomouc, Czech Republic. The cohort consists of 221 patients who underwent the first repeated biopsy after an initial biopsy with a negative outcome. All patients had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels between 1.5 and 16.5 ng/mL and a prostate volume not greater than 100mL. A logistic regression model was fitted.
Results: Of the 221 patients, 29 (13%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer on the repeated biopsy. The final model includes the PSA level and the transitory zone volume as predictors. Its accuracy is 76.4%. The cut-off point of 0.0687 in the predicted positive repeated biopsy outcome assures 95% sensitivity and prevents 42% of unnecessary biopsies.

Objective: To test the accuracy of serum isoform [-2]proPSA (p2PSA) and its derivatives, percentage of p2PSA to free PSA (fPSA; %p2PSA) and the Prostate Health Index (PHI)-called index tests-in discriminating between patients with and without PCa.
Design, setting, and participants: This was an observational, prospective cohort study of patients from five European urologic centers with a total PSA (tPSA) range of 2-10 ng/ml who were subjected to initial prostate biopsy for suspected PCa.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The primary end point was to evaluate the specificity, sensitivity, and diagnostic accuracy of index tests in determining the presence of PCa at prostate biopsy in comparison to tPSA, fPSA, and percentage of fPSA to tPSA (%fPSA) (standard tests) and the number of prostate biopsies that could be spared using these tests. Multivariable logistic regression models were complemented by predictive accuracy analysis and decision curve analysis.
Results and limitations: Of >646 patients, PCa was diagnosed in 264 (40.1%).

Prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) has emerged as a predictor of prostate cancer.
Methods: We sought to define the utility of PCA3 in combination with other clinical data in predicting the risk of prostate cancer on repeat biopsy. We retrospectively obtained PCA3, PSA, PSA density (PSAD), digital rectal examination (DRE) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) findings from 103 patients at a single institution who had at least one prior negative prostate biopsy. The sensitivity and specificity of PCA3 in detecting prostate cancer was determined. Receiver operating characteristics curves were produced for each variable individually and in multivariable analysis, controlling for PCA3, PSAD, TRUS, PSA and DRE. A nomogram was created, internally validated and compared to another recently published nomogram.
Results: Of the 103 patients, 37 (31%) had prostate cancer on repeat biopsy. The sensitivity and specificity of PCA3 (using a cut point of 25) was 0.67 and 0.64, respectively. In multivariable analyses, PCA3 was independently associated with prostate cancer (odds ratio: 1.02, 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.04), with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.64.

Methods: Between 2002 and 2010, 1059 Japanese men with PSA levels between 1.1 and 40 ng ml(-1) and biopsied for the first time using the adjusted method at Gunma University Hospital were enrolled. All subjects underwent digital rectal examination (DRE) and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS). Data from the initial 849 subjects were used for development of the nomogram and those from the final 210 subjects were used for internal validation. External validation was conducted using data from two affiliated hospitals where the same adjusted biopsy method was used. The nomogram was developed through logistic regression analysis, and predictive accuracy and performance characteristics were assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics and calibration plots. Furthermore, we compared the predictive accuracy of the newly developed nomogram with the 'Prostate Risk Indicator' using the development data set, as well as the two external data sets.
Results: The AUC of the logistic regression-based nomogram was significantly higher than those of any single clinical parameter. External validation showed significant correlations with the present model. The AUC-receiver operating characteristic of the 'Prostate Risk Indicator' was the second largest following the new nomogram using the development data set and one external data set and almost equal to the new nomogram using the other external data set.
Conclusions: Nevertheless the present model does not include somewhat subjective findings on TRUS abnormality, which is necessary for the estimation by 'Prostate Risk Indicator', the predictive accuracy of the present simple nomogram could be excellent enough to contribute to accurate shared decision-making between doctors and men who are candidates for the adjusted biopsy scheme."

Total prostate volume ranged from 7.1 to 119.2 cc (median: 35). Overall, 71 (34.8%) CaP were detected. Of men with suspicious DRE, 28 (60.9%) had CaP on initial biopsy. The ANN was 78% accurate in the original report. The AUC of ROC curve analysis was 0.51 for PSA, 0.66 for %PSA, and 0.72 for the ANN-Output, respectively.
Conclusions: Our results in this independent cohort show that ANN is a very helpful parameter in daily routine to increase the CaP detection rate and reduce unnecessary biopsies."

Many nomograms have been developed to predict the outcome of initial PBx. However, most require information not available at the decision to biopsy.
Methods: From March 2000 to April 2010, 1551 men with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 鈮10 ng/mL who underwent initial extended PBx were included in the present study. The nomogram predictor variables were patient age, race, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, percent free PSA, family history of PCa, and the digital rectal examination findings. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated as a measure of discrimination. The calibration was assessed graphically.
Results: Of the 1551 men, 606 (39.1%) had PCa on biopsy. The mean value for age, PSA, and percent free PSA was 63.4 years, 5.1 ng/mL, and 21.4%, respectively. Also, 25.1% and 7.8% of patients with positive PBx findings had digital rectal examination abnormalities and a positive family history, respectively. The univariate and multivariate analyses suggested that all 6 risk factors were predictors of PCa in the study cohort (P < .05). The area under the curve for all factors in a model predicting PCa was 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.71-0.76). The area under the curve for predicting high-grade PCa was 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.69-0.74).
Conclusions: The present predictive model allows an assessment of the risk of PCa and high-grade PCa for men undergoing initial extended PBx using readily available, noninvasively obtained clinical data."

Therefore, patients should be counseled about the risk of missing an incidental prostate cancer (incPCa). In this study the risk of an incPCa was determined based on all preoperative parameters.
Methods: Thousand three hundred and fifty seven (04/2004-09/2008) patients underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in our department. Cases with less than 10 g removed tissue, PSA >20 ng/ml or with known PCa were excluded. Data of the remaining 1,000 consecutive patients were collected retrospectively and statistically analyzed using SAS.
Results: Mean age was 69.4 (36-96) years, mean PSA 4.41 (0.08-19.5) ng/ml, mean weight of removed tissue 30.9 (10-110) g. An incPCa was detected in 111 cases. Thirty-four out of these were considered to be clinically relevant (relPCa; stage T1b and/or Gleason sum 鈮7). In univariate analysis age, volume of the prostate and body mass index correlated with incPCa while age, volume of the prostate and PSA correlated with relPCa. Predictive parameters for a multivariate logistic regression model are age and body mass index for incPCa and age, prostate volume, and number of prior biopsies for relPCa.
Conclusions: More than 1 in 10 patients undergoing TURP has an incPCa and 3.4% have a relPCa. Patients should be counseled carefully about the risk of missing especially relPCa when undergoing vaporization of the prostate. Our model significantly improves prediction of relPCa compared to PSA and digital examination alone."

The low specificity of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) results in diagnostic biopsies in men without prostate cancer (PCa). Additional information, such as genetic markers, could be used to avoid unnecessary biopsies.
Objective: To determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PCa can be used to determine whether biopsy of the prostate is necessary.
Design, settings, and participants: The Stockholm-1 cohort (n = 5241) consisted of men who underwent a prostate biopsy during 2005 to 2007. PSA levels were retrieved from databases and family histories were obtained using a questionnaire. Thirty-five validated SNPs were analysed and converted into a genetic risk score that was implemented in a risk-prediction model.
Results and limitations: When comparing the nongenetic model (based on age, PSA, free-to-total PSA, and family history) with the genetic model and using a fixed number of detected PCa cases, it was found that the genetic model required significantly fewer biopsies than the nongenetic model, with 480 biopsies (22.7%) avoided, at a cost of missing a PCa diagnosis in 3% of patients characterised as having an aggressive disease. However, the overall genetic model does not discriminate between aggressive and nonaggressive cases.
Conclusion: Although the genetic model reduced the number of biopsies more than the nongenetic model, the clinical significance of this finding requires further evaluation."

Methods: From Jul 2014 to Aug 2016, data on 1144 patients who had undergone the initial prostate biopsies were prospectively collected and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the independent predictors for PCa and HPPCa. Based on independent predictors, nomogram models were developed and internally validated to assess a man's risk of harboring PCa and HPPCa.
Results: The detection rates of PCa and HPPCa were 43.09% (493/1144) and 39.16% (448/1144), respectively. In the multivariate analyses, age, PSA, TZV, DRE, and TRUS instead of PV or PVI were independent predictors for PCa and HPPCa, percent free PSA was independent predictor for PCa not for HPPCa. Such independent predictors were finally included in the nomogram models. The AUCs of TZV-based nomogram models were 87.0% for PCa and 87.7% for HPPCa, which were higher than that of PSA alone or other predictive models.

Materials and methods: The study population included 728 men, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of 2-10 ng/mL and a negative digital rectal examination, enrolled in a prospective, multi-site early detection trial. The primary endpoint was aggressive prostate cancer, defined as biopsy Gleason score 鈮7. First, we evaluated whether the addition of PHI improves the performance of currently available risk calculators (the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial [PCPT] and European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer [ERSPC] risk calculators). We also designed and internally validated a new PHI-based multivariable predictive model, and created a nomogram.
Results: Of 728 men undergoing biopsy, 118 (16.2%) had aggressive prostate cancer. The PHI predicted the risk of aggressive prostate cancer across the spectrum of values. Adding PHI significantly improved the predictive accuracy of the PCPT and ERSPC risk calculators for aggressive disease. A new model was created using age, previous biopsy, prostate volume, PSA and PHI, with an area under the curve of 0.746. The bootstrap-corrected model showed good calibration with observed risk for aggressive prostate cancer and had net benefit on decision-curve analysis.

Although this model accurately predicts the result of biopsy in unscreened men, its properties for men with a history of PSA screening have not been fully characterized.
Experimental design: A total of 1,501 previously screened men with elevated PSA underwent initial biopsy during rounds 2 and 3 of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, Rotterdam, with 388 cancers diagnosed. Biomarker levels were measured in serum samples taken before biopsy. The prediction model developed on the unscreened cohort was then applied and predictions compared with biopsy outcome.
Results: The previously developed four-kallikrein prediction model had much higher predictive accuracy than PSA and age alone (area under the curve of 0.711 versus 0.585, and 0.713 versus 0.557 with and without digital rectal exam, respectively; both P < 0.001). Similar statistically significant enhancements were seen for high-grade cancer. Applying the model with a cutoff of 20% cancer risk as the criterion for biopsy would reduce the biopsy rate by 362 for every 1,000 men with elevated PSA. Although diagnosis would be delayed for 47 cancers, these would be predominately low-stage and low-grade (83% Gleason 6 T(1c)).

The ability to identify IPCa prior to definitive therapy was tested.
Methods: In a cohort of 1132 men a nomogram was developed to predict the probability of IPCa. Predictors consisted of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), clinical stage, biopsy Gleason sum, core cancer length and percentage of positive biopsy cores (percent positive cores). IPCa was defined as organ-confined PCa (OC) with tumor volume (TV) <0.5 cc and without Gleason 4 or 5 patterns. Finally, an external validation of the most accurate IPCa nomogram was performed in the same group.
Results: IPCa was pathologically confirmed in 65 (5.7%) men. The 200 bootstrap-corrected predictive accuracy of the new nomogram was 90% versus 81% for the older nomogram. However, in cutoff-based analyses of patients who were qualified by our and the older nomograms as high probability for IPCa, respectively 63% and 45% harbored aggressive PCa variants at radical prostatectomy (Gleason score 7-10, ECE, SVI, and/or LNI).

On the basis of those findings, they developed a nomogram to predict the probability of low-volume/low-grade prostate cancer specifically for men with a single positive biopsy core.
Methods: The study cohort comprised 258 men who underwent radical prostatectomy without neoadjuvant therapy. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in only 1 core of an extended biopsy scheme. Low-volume/low-grade cancer was defined as pathologic organ-confined disease and a tumor volume<0.5 cc with no Gleason grade 4 or 5 cancer. Patient age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, prostate volume, PSA density (PSAD), and tumor length in a biopsy core were examined as variables. A fitted multiple logistic regression model was used to establish the nomogram.
Results: One hundred thirty-three patients (51.6%) had low-volume/low-grade cancer. To establish the nomogram, age, PSAD, and tumor length were adopted as variables. The fitted model suggested that older age, higher PSAD values, and greater tumor length would reduce the probability of low-volume/low-grade cancer. The nomogram predicted low-volume/low-grade cancer with good discrimination (an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.727). Calibration of this nomogram showed good predicted probability.
Conclusions: The authors established a nomogram with which to predict low-volume/low-grade cancer in men with 1 positive biopsy core in an extended biopsy scheme, and they recommend this nomogram for use in selecting men for active surveillance."

Patients and methods: We evaluated 9473 patients undergoing initial prostate biopsy at three equal-access healthcare institutes from 1993 to 2003. At each biopsy session, patient age, race, serum prostate-specific antigen level (PSA), digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, number of biopsy cores taken, year of biopsy, and pathological findings were recorded. A logistic regression model was constructed to evaluate predictors of cancer detection based on pre-biopsy variables. The model was internally validated using the bootstrap statistical method, and a nomogram was constructed.
Results: Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 1895 (33%) AA men and 991 (26%) Caucasians. AA men had a significantly higher mean serum PSA level than Caucasians, at 13.0 and 8.5 ng/mL, respectively (P < 0.001). The mean ages were similar between AA and Caucasian men (P = 0.23), but Caucasian men had a higher incidence of an abnormal DRE (P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, age, race, year of biopsy, PSA level, DRE, and number of cores taken were all statistically significant (P < 0.001). Hazard ratios were (controlling for year of biopsy); age (1.30), Caucasian race (0.74), PSA level (1.47), DRE (1.75), and number of cores taken (1.19). The predicted model had a boot-strapped concordance index of 0.75.

Because the incidence of prostate cancer is lower among Asian men, nomograms based on Western populations cannot be directly applied to Japanese men. We, therefore, developed a model for predicting the probability of a positive initial prostate biopsy using clinical and laboratory data from a Japanese male population.
Methods: Data were collected from 834 Japanese male referrals who underwent initial prostate biopsies as individual screening. We analyzed age, total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, free/total PSA (f/t PSA) ratio, prostate volume, and digital rectal examination findings. Of these data, we randomly reserved 20% for study validation. Logistic regression analysis estimated relative risk, 95% confidence intervals, and P values.
Results: Independent predictors of a positive biopsy result included elevated PSA levels, decreased f/T PSA ratio, advanced age, small prostate volume, and abnormal digital rectal examination findings. We developed a predictive nomogram for an initial positive biopsy using these variables. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the model was 81.8%, which was significantly greater than that of the prediction based on PSA alone (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 67.8%). If externally validated, applying this model could reduce unnecessary biopsy procedures by 32% and reduce the overall need for prostate biopsies by 26%.
Conclusions: In this study of a Japanese population, incorporating clinical and laboratory data into a prebiopsy nomogram significantly improved the prediction of prostate cancer compared with predictions based solely on the individual factors."

This report outlines a comprehensive data science strategy for building such tools with application to the Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group prostate cancer risk prediction tool.
Methods: We created models for high-grade prostate cancer risk using six established risk factors. The data comprised 8492 prostate biopsies collected from ten institutions, 2 in Europe and 8 across North America. We calculated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for discrimination, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test statistic (HLS) for calibration and the clinical net benefit at risk threshold 15%. We implemented several internal cross-validation schemes to assess the influence of modeling method and individual cohort on validation performance.
Results: High-grade disease prevalence ranged from 18% in Zurich (1863 biopsies) to 39% in UT Health San Antonio (899 biopsies). Visualization revealed outliers in terms of risk factors, including San Juan VA (51% abnormal digital rectal exam), Durham VA (63% African American), and Zurich (2.8% family history). Exclusion of any cohort did not significantly affect the AUC or HLS, nor did the choice of prediction model (pooled, random-effects, meta-analysis). Excluding the lowest-prevalence Zurich cohort from training sets did not statistically significantly change the validation metrics for any of the individual cohorts, except for Sunnybrook, where the effect on the AUC was minimal. Therefore the final multivariable logistic model was built by pooling the data from all cohorts using logistic regression. Higher prostate-specific antigen and age, abnormal digital rectal exam, African ancestry and a family history of prostate cancer increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer, while a history of a prior negative prostate biopsy decreased risk (all p-values < 0.004).
Conclusions: We have outlined a multi-cohort model-building internal validation strategy for developing globally accessible and scalable risk prediction tools."

We evaluated the accuracy of the Tyrer-Cuzick model for predicting invasive breast cancer (IBC) development among women with LCIS.
Methods: Women with LCIS participating in surveillance from 1987 to 2017 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Tyrer-Cuzick score (version 7) was calculated near the time of LCIS diagnosis. Patients with prior or concurrent breast cancer, a BRCA mutation, receiving chemoprevention, or with pleomorphic LCIS were excluded. Invasive cancer-free probability was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Results: A total of 1192 women with a median follow-up of 6 years (interquartile range [IQR] 2.5-9.9) were included. Median age at LCIS diagnosis was 49 years (IQR 45-55), 88% were white; 37% were postmenopausal, 28% had 鈮 1 first-degree family member with breast cancer, and 13% had 鈮 2 second-degree family members with breast cancer.

However, they have been modelled and validated almost exclusively in Caucasian cohorts, hence limiting their use in other population groups. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of the ERSPC risk calculator in a South African cohort.
Methods: Patients who have had a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy at Groote Schuur Hospital from January 2008 to August 2017 were reviewed. Predictor variables were entered into the ERSPC risk calculator and results were compared with prostate biopsy pathology results. Predictive accuracy of the ERSPC risk calculator for these patients was derived using receiver operator characteristics (ROC) Area under the curve and is expressed as a percentage.
Results: 516 prostate biopsy sessions in 475 different men were analysed. The predictive accuracy of the ERSPC risk calculator was better than a PSA/DRE strategy for the presence of cancer-0.738 (95% CI 0.695-0.781) vs 0.686 (95% CI 0.639-0.732), and for significant PCa-0.833 (95% CI 0.789-0.876) vs 0.793 (95% CI 0.741-0.846). This translated into 50 less biopsies when compared to a PSA > 4/abnormal DRE strategy. Use of the ERSPC RC would have missed eight non-significant cancers [Significant cancer being defined as having a tumour stage T2b (> 1/2 lobe involved with prostate cancer) and/or a Gleason Score equal to or greater than 7].
Conclusion: Our results confirm the validity of the ERSPC RC in a South African cohort. Application of this calculator to the wider South African population would allow better selection of patients for prostate biopsy and spare a significant number its adverse consequences."

Objectives: To guide skin surveillance, we developed a risk prediction model for subsequent primary melanomas, using demographic, phenotypical, histopathological, sun exposure and genomic risk factors.
Methods: Using Cox regression frailty models, we analysed data for 2613 primary melanomas from 1266 patients recruited to the population-based Genes, Environment and Melanoma study in New South Wales, Australia, with a median of 14 years' follow-up via the cancer registry. Discrimination and calibration were assessed.
Results: The median time to diagnosis of a subsequent primary melanoma decreased with each new primary melanoma. The final model included 12 risk factors. Harrell's C-statistic was 0路73 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0路68-0路77], 0路65 (95% CI 0路62-0路68) and 0路65 (95% CI 0路61-0路69) for predicting second, third and fourth primary melanomas, respectively.

Conclusions: The risk of developing a subsequent primary melanoma varies considerably between individuals and is particularly high for those with two or more primary melanomas. The risk prediction model and its associated nomograms enable estimation of the absolute risk of subsequent primary melanoma, on the basis of on an individual's risk factors, and can be used to tailor surveillance intensity, communicate risk and provide patient education. What's already known about this topic? Current guidelines for the frequency and length of follow-up to detect new primary melanomas in patients with one or more previous primary melanomas are based on limited evidence. People with one or more primary melanomas have, on average, a higher risk of developing another primary invasive melanoma, compared with the general population, but an accurate way of estimating individual risk is needed. What does this study add? We provide a comprehensive risk prediction model for subsequent primary melanomas, using data from 1266 participants with melanoma (2613 primary melanomas), over a median 14 years' follow-up. The model includes 12 risk factors comprising demographic, phenotypical, histopathological and genomic factors, and sun exposure.

Objectives: To develop and validate a model for incident first-primary cutaneous melanoma using clinically assessed risk factors.
Methods: We used unconditional logistic regression with backward selection from the Australian Melanoma Family Study (461 cases and 329 controls) in which age, sex and city of recruitment were kept in each step, and we externally validated it using the Leeds Melanoma Case-Control Study (960 cases and 513 controls). Candidate predictors included clinically assessed whole-body naevi and solar lentigines, and self-assessed pigmentation phenotype, sun exposure, family history and history of keratinocyte cancer. We evaluated the predictive strength and discrimination of the model risk factors using odds per age- and sex-adjusted SD (OPERA) and the area under curve (AUC), and calibration using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.
Results: The final model included the number of naevi 鈮 2 mm in diameter on the whole body, solar lentigines on the upper back (a six-level scale), hair colour at age 18 years and personal history of keratinocyte cancer.

What's already known about this topic? Melanoma risk prediction models may be useful in prevention by tailoring interventions to personalized risk levels.

We present a melanoma risk prediction model, which includes clinically-assessed whole-body naevi and solar lentigines, and self-assessed risk factors including pigmentation phenotype and history of keratinocyte cancer. This model performs well on discrimination, the model's ability to distinguish between individuals with and without melanoma, and may assist clinicians to stratify patients by melanoma risk for targeted preventive interventions."

Objectives: To develop and validate a model for incident first-primary cutaneous melanoma using clinically assessed risk factors.
Methods: We used unconditional logistic regression with backward selection from the Australian Melanoma Family Study (461 cases and 329 controls) in which age, sex and city of recruitment were kept in each step, and we externally validated it using the Leeds Melanoma Case-Control Study (960 cases and 513 controls). Candidate predictors included clinically assessed whole-body naevi and solar lentigines, and self-assessed pigmentation phenotype, sun exposure, family history and history of keratinocyte cancer. We evaluated the predictive strength and discrimination of the model risk factors using odds per age- and sex-adjusted SD (OPERA) and the area under curve (AUC), and calibration using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.
Results: The final model included the number of naevi 鈮 2 mm in diameter on the whole body, solar lentigines on the upper back (a six-level scale), hair colour at age 18 years and personal history of keratinocyte cancer. Naevi was the strongest risk factor; the OPERA was 3路51 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2路71-4路54] in the Australian study and 2路56 (95% CI 2路23-2路95) in the Leeds study.

We added nicotine dependence as the primary exposure in two published lung cancer risk prediction models (Katki-Gu or PLCO-m2012) and compared four results: with no tobacco-dependence measure, with time to first cigarette, with heaviness of smoking index, and with Fagestrom test for nicotine dependence.

Geometric features of dense tissue over the breast and the presence of texture structures contained in sliding windows that scan the mammograms may improve the predictive ability when combined with the breast dense tissue percentage.
Methods: A case/control study nested within a screening program covering 1563 women with craniocaudal and mediolateral-oblique mammograms (755 controls and the contralateral breast mammograms at the closest screening visit before cancer diagnostic for 808 cases) aging 45 to 70 from Comunitat Valenciana (Spain) was used to extract geometric and texture features. The dense tissue segmentation was performed using DMScan and validated by two experienced radiologists. A model based on Random Forests was trained several times varying the set of variables. A training dataset of 1172 patients was evaluated with a 10-stratified-fold cross-validation scheme. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) was the metric for the predictive ability. The results were assessed by only considering the output after applying the model to the test set, which was composed of the remaining 391 patients.
Results: The AUC score obtained by the dense tissue percentage (0.55) was compared to a machine learning-based classifier results. The classifier, apart from the percentage of dense tissue of both views, firstly included global geometric features such as the distance of dense tissue to the pectoral muscle, dense tissue eccentricity or the dense tissue perimeter, obtaining an accuracy of 0.56. By the inclusion of a global feature based on local histograms of oriented gradients, the accuracy of the classifier was significantly improved (0.61). The number of well-classified patients was improved up to 236 when it was 208.
Conclusion: Relative geometric features of dense tissue over the breast and histograms of standardized local texture features based on sliding windows scanning the whole breast improve risk prediction beyond the dense tissue percentage adjusted by geometrical variables. Other classifiers could improve the results obtained by the conventional Random Forests used in this study."

Colorectal cancers usually evolve from advanced neoplasms that are present for years. We applied the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CRC Risk Assessment Tool, which calculates future risk of CRC, to determine whether it could be used to predict current advanced neoplasia (AN) in a veteran cohort undergoing a baseline screening colonoscopy.
Methods: This was a prospective assessment of the relationship between future CRC risk predicted by the NCI tool, and the presence of AN at screening colonoscopy. Family, medical, dietary and physical activity histories were collected at the time of screening colonoscopy and used to calculate absolute CRC risk at 5, 10 and 20 years. Discriminatory accuracy was assessed.
Results: Of 3121 veterans undergoing screening colonoscopy, 94% had complete data available to calculate risk (N = 2934, median age 63 years, 100% men, and 15% minorities). Prevalence of AN at baseline screening colonoscopy was 11 % (N = 313). For tertiles of estimated absolute CRC risk at 5 years, AN prevalences were 6.54% (95% CI, 4.99, 8.09), 11.26% (95% CI, 9.28-13.24), and 14.21% (95% CI, 12.02-16.40). For tertiles of estimated risk at 10 years, the prevalences were 6.34% (95% CI, 4.81-7.87), 11.25% (95% CI, 9.27-13.23), and 14.42% (95% CI, 12.22-16.62). For tertiles of estimated absolute CRC risk at 20 years, current AN prevalences were 7.54% (95% CI, 5.75-9.33), 10.53% (95% CI, 8.45-12.61), and 12.44% (95% CI, 10.2-14.68). The area under the curve for predicting current AN was 0.60 (95% CI; 0.57-0.63, p < 0.0001) at 5 years, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.57-0.63, p < 0.0001) at 10 years and 0.58 (95% CI, 0.54-0.61, p < 0.0001) at 20 years.

Serum and urinary cotinine are validated biomarkers for cigarette exposure. Their performance for lung cancer risk prediction has not been simultaneously examined in epidemiologic studies.
Methods: A nested case-control study, including 452 incident lung cancer cases and 452 smoking-matched controls in the Shanghai cohort study, was conducted. Mass spectrometry-based methods were used to quantify cotinine in serum and urine samples collected from current smokers at baseline, on average 10 years before cancer diagnosis of cases. Logistic regression was used to estimate ORs, 95% confidence intervals (CI), and AUC ROC for lung cancer associated with higher levels of cotinine.
Results: Serum and urinary cotinine levels were significantly higher in lung cancer cases than controls. Compared with the lowest quartile serum cotinine (鈮0.40 nmol/mL), the OR of lung cancer for smokers in the highest quartiles (>1.39 nmol/mL) was 5.46 (95% CI, 3.38-8.81). Similarly, the OR was 5.49 (95% CI, 3.39-8.87) for highest (>16.38 nmol/mg creatinine) relative to the lowest quartile of urinary total cotinine (鈮4.11 nmol/mg creatinine).

Methods: We conducted a retrospective Institutional Review Board-approved study on a case-control cohort of 226 patients (including 113 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 113 controls) who underwent general population breast cancer screening. For each patient, a prior normal (i.e., with negative or benign findings) digital mammogram examination [including mediolateral oblique (MLO) view and craniocaudal (CC) view two images] was collected. Thus, a total of 452 normal images (226 MLO view images and 226 CC view images) of this case-control cohort were analyzed to predict the outcome, i.e., developing breast cancer (cancer cases) or remaining breast cancer-free (controls) within the follow-up period. We implemented an end-to-end deep learning model and a GoogLeNet-LDA model and compared their effects in several experimental settings using two mammographic view images and inputting two different subregions of the images to the models. The proposed models were also compared to logistic regression modeling of mammographic breast density. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used as the model performance metric.
Results: The highest AUC was 0.73 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.68-0.78; GoogLeNet-LDA model on CC view] when using the whole-breast and was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.67-0.76; GoogLeNet-LDA model on MLO + CC view) when using the dense tissue, respectively, as the model input. The GoogleNet-LDA model significantly (all P < 0.05) outperformed the end-to-end GoogLeNet model in all experiments. CC view was consistently more predictive than MLO view in both deep learning models, regardless of the input subregions. Both models exhibited superior performance than the percent breast density (AUC = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.49-0.59).
Conclusions: The proposed deep learning modeling approach can predict short-term breast cancer risk using normal screening mammogram images. Larger studies are needed to further reveal the promise of deep learning in enhancing imaging-based breast cancer risk assessment."

However, risk stratification tools for the identification of high-risk individuals do not exist. In this study, an individualized risk prediction model was developed and validated for oropharynx cancers in the US population.
Methods: A synthetic, US population-based case-control study was conducted. Oropharynx cancer cases diagnosed at Ohio State University (n = 241) were propensity-weighted to represent oropharynx cancers occurring annually in the United States during 2009-2014 (n = 12,656). Controls (n = 9327) included participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2009-2014) and represented the annual US population aged 30 to 69 years (n = 154,532,508). The individualized 1-year absolute risk of oropharynx cancer was estimated with weighted logistic regression.
Results: The risk prediction model included age, sex, race, smoking, alcohol use, lifetime sexual partners, and oral oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) status. The model had good discrimination and calibration in split-sample validation (area under the curve [AUC], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-0.97; observed/expected [O/E], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.70-1.32) and external validation (AUC, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.84-0.90; O/E, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.77-1.39). In the US population, 1-year predicted risks of oropharynx cancer were highest for older individuals (21.1/100,000 for 65- to 69-year-olds), men (13.9/100,000), whites (10.4/100,000), smokers (18.0/100,000 for >20 pack-years), heavy alcohol users (18.4/100,000), and those with prevalent oral oncogenic HPV (140.4/100,000). The risk prediction model provided substantial risk stratification, with approximately 77% of all oropharynx cancers and approximately 99% of HPV-positive oropharynx cancers occurring in the 10% of the US population with the highest model-predicted risk.
Conclusions: This risk prediction model will enable the efficient design of studies to address the outstanding questions pertaining to the natural history, screening, and secondary prevention of oropharynx cancers."

Objective: To develop a unified risk prediction model (S3M-MRI) that combines the Stockholm3 score (based on protein and genetic markers and clinical variables) and Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System v.2 scores modified for MRI without contrast (modPI-RADS).
Design, setting, and participants: We used data for 532 men from the prospective multicentre STHLM3-MRI diagnostic study to construct S3M-MRI. We compared S3M-MRI to Stockholm3 and modPI-RADS alone with respect to model discrimination, calibration, and net benefit. We also compared clinical outcomes for five diagnostic strategies according to the use of combinations of the three models.
Results and limitations: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-0.91) for S3M-MRI, which was significantly higher (p=0.04) than for Stockholm3 (0.86, 95% CI 0.83-0.89) and modPI-RADS (0.83, 95% CI 0.79-0.87). S3M-MRI had a higher net benefit on decision curve analysis for clinically relevant probability thresholds for biopsy recommendation in comparison to Stockholm3 and modPI-RADS. However, for different diagnostic strategies, sequential use of Stockholm3 followed by MRI only for Stockholm3-positive men resulted in a similar number of unnecessary biopsies (64 vs 69) and diagnosed International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group 1 cancers (56 vs 51) at similar sensitivity for ISUP grade group 鈮2 cancers, while avoiding 38% of MRI scans. Limitations include the ethnically homogeneous study population.

FGFR2 had the best discrimination ability, followed by MAP3K1 and CASP8. Discriminative accuracy of the genetic risk model distinguishing the breast cancer patients and controls explained by AUC was 0.728, with 70.6% sensitivity and 65.1% specificity. Our study results therefore confirmed polygenic breast cancer inheritance with important involvement of FGFR2, MAP3K1, LSP1 and CASP8 gene variants."

We assessed the accuracy of the Vancouver Lung Cancer Risk Prediction Model compared with that of trainee and experienced radiologists using a subset of size-matched nodules from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST).
Methods: One hundred cases from the NLST database were selected (size range, 4-20 mm), including 20 proven cancers and 80 size-matched benign nodules. Three experienced thoracic radiologists and three trainee radiologists were asked to estimate the likelihood of cancer in each case, first independently, and then with knowledge of the model's risk prediction. The results generated by the model alone also were estimated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for each viewing condition was calculated, and statistical significance in their differences was tested by using the Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz method.
Results: Human observers were more accurate (AUC value of 0.85 卤 0.05 [SD]) than was the model (0.77 卤 0.06) in estimating the risk of malignancy (P = .0010), and use of the model did not improve their accuracy (0.84 卤 0.06). Experienced radiologists performed better than did trainees. Human observers could distinguish benign from malignant nodule morphology more accurately than could the model, which relies mainly on nodule size for risk estimation.
Conclusions: Experienced and trainee radiologists had superior ability to predict the risk of cancer in size-matched nodules from a screening trial compared with that of the Vancouver model, and use of the model did not improve their accuracy."

Premenopausal concentrations of circulating anti-M眉llerian hormone (AMH), a biomarker of ovarian reserve, and testosterone have been positively associated with breast cancer risk in prospective studies. We assessed whether adding AMH and/or testosterone to the Gail model improves its prediction performance for women aged 35-50.
Methods: In a nested case-control study including ten prospective cohorts (1762 invasive cases/1890 matched controls) with pre-diagnostic serum/plasma samples, we estimated relative risks (RR) for the biomarkers and Gail risk factors using conditional logistic regression and random-effects meta-analysis. Absolute risk models were developed using these RR estimates, attributable risk fractions calculated using the distributions of the risk factors in the cases from the consortium, and population-based incidence and mortality rates. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare the discriminatory accuracy of the models with and without biomarkers.
Results: The AUC for invasive breast cancer including only the Gail risk factor variables was 55.3 (95% CI 53.4, 57.1). The AUC increased moderately with the addition of AMH (AUC 57.6, 95% CI 55.7, 59.5), testosterone (AUC 56.2, 95% CI 54.4, 58.1), or both (AUC 58.1, 95% CI 56.2, 59.9).

Conclusions: AMH and testosterone moderately increase the discriminatory accuracy of the Gail model among women aged 35-50. We observed the largest AUC increase for women without a family history of breast cancer, the group that would benefit most from improved risk prediction because early screening is already recommended for women with a family history."
297,30821827,JAMA Netw Open,10.5,To develop and validate a risk prediction model that incorporates low-dose computed tomography screening results. ,,Logistic Regression,0.761,,,,,development,"Screening Results In 8 Levels, Screening Results In 4 Levels",in recent 10 years,2019,America,America,Lung Cancer,"Importance: Low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening is most effective when applied to high-risk individuals.
Objectives: To develop and validate a risk prediction model that incorporates low-dose computed tomography screening results.
Design, setting, and participants: A logistic regression risk model was developed in National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) Lung Screening Study (LSS) data and was validated in NLST American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) data. The NLST was a randomized clinical trial that recruited participants between August 2002 and April 2004, with follow-up to December 31, 2009. This secondary analysis of data from the NLST took place between August 10, 2013, and November 1, 2018. Included were LSS (n = 14 576) and ACRIN (n = 7653) participants who had 3 screens, adequate follow-up, and complete predictor information.
Main outcomes and measures: Incident lung cancers occurring 1 to 4 years after the third screen (202 LSS and 96 ACRIN). Predictors included scores from the validated PLCOm2012 risk model and Lung CT Screening Reporting & Data System (Lung-RADS) screening results.
Results: Overall, the mean (SD) age of 22 229 participants was 61.3 (5.0) years, 59.3% were male, and 90.9% were of non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity. During follow-up, 298 lung cancers were diagnosed in 22 229 individuals (1.3%). Eight result combinations were pooled into 4 groups based on similar associations. Adjusted for PLCOm2012 risks, compared with participants with 3 negative screens, participants with 1 positive screen and last negative had an odds ratio (OR) of 1.93 (95% CI, 1.34-2.76), and participants with 2 positive screens with last negative or 2 negative screens with last positive had an OR of 2.66 (95% CI, 1.60-4.43); when 2 or more screens were positive with last positive, the OR was 8.97 (95% CI, 5.76-13.97). In ACRIN validation data, the model that included PLCOm2012 scores and screening results (PLCO2012results) demonstrated significantly greater discrimination (area under the curve, 0.761; 95% CI, 0.716-0.799) than when screening results were excluded (PLCOm2012) (area under the curve, 0.687; 95% CI, 0.645-0.728) (P < .001). In ACRIN validation data, PLCO2012results demonstrated good calibration. Individuals who had initial negative scans but elevated PLCOm2012 six-year risks of at least 2.6% did not have risks decline below the 1.5% screening eligibility criterion when subsequent screens were negative.
Conclusions and relevance: According to this analysis, some individuals with elevated risk scores who have negative initial screens remain at elevated risks, warranting annual screening. Positive screens seem to increase baseline risk scores and may identify high-risk individuals for continued screening and enrollment into clinical trials.

Few independent validations had been done using cohorts for common breast cancer risk prediction models, and those that have been done had small sample sizes and short follow-up periods, and used earlier versions of the prediction tools. We aimed to validate the relative performance of four commonly used models of breast cancer risk and assess the effect of limited data input on each one's performance.
Methods: In this validation study, we used the Breast Cancer Prospective Family Study Cohort (ProF-SC), which includes 18 856 women from Australia, Canada, and the USA who did not have breast cancer at recruitment, between March 17, 1992, and June 29, 2011. We selected women from the cohort who were 20-70 years old and had no previous history of bilateral prophylactic mastectomy or ovarian cancer, at least 2 months of follow-up data, and information available about family history of breast cancer. We used this selected cohort to calculate 10-year risk scores and compare four models of breast cancer risk prediction: the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm model (BOADICEA), BRCAPRO, the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT), and the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study model (IBIS). We compared model calibration based on the ratio of the expected number of breast cancer cases to the observed number of breast cancer cases in the cohort, and on the basis of their discriminatory ability to separate those who will and will not have breast cancer diagnosed within 10 years as measured with the concordance statistic (C-statistic). We did subgroup analyses to compare the performance of the models at 10 years in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers (ie, BRCA-positive women), tested non-carriers and untested participants (ie, BRCA-negative women), and participants younger than 50 years at recruitment. We also assessed the effect that limited data input (eg, restriction of the amount of family history and non-genetic information included) had on the models' performance.
Findings: After median follow-up of 11路1 years (IQR 6路0-14路4), 619 (4%) of 15 732 women selected from the ProF-SC cohort study were prospectively diagnosed with breast cancer after recruitment, of whom 519 (84%) had histologically confirmed disease. BOADICEA and IBIS were well calibrated in the overall validation cohort, whereas BRCAPRO and BCRAT underpredicted risk (ratio of expected cases to observed cases 1路05 [95% CI 0路97-1路14] for BOADICEA, 1路03 [0路96-1路12] for IBIS, 0路59 [0路55-0路64] for BRCAPRO, and 0路79 [0路73-0路85] for BRCAT). The estimated C-statistics for the complete validation cohort were 0路70 (95% CI 0路68-0路72) for BOADICEA, 0路71 (0路69-0路73) for IBIS, 0路68 (0路65-0路70) for BRCAPRO, and 0路60 (0路58-0路62) for BCRAT. In subgroup analyses by BRCA mutation status, the ratio of expected to observed cases for BRCA-negative women was 1路02 (95% CI 0路93-1路12) for BOADICEA, 1路00 (0路92-1路10) for IBIS, 0路53 (0路49-0路58) for BRCAPRO, and 0路97 (0路89-1路06) for BCRAT. For BRCA-positive participants, BOADICEA and IBIS were well calibrated, but BRCAPRO underpredicted risk (ratio of expected to observed cases 1路17 [95% CI 0路99-1路38] for BOADICEA, 1路14 [0路96-1路35] for IBIS, and 0路80 [0路68-0路95] for BRCAPRO). We noted similar patterns of calibration for women younger than 50 years at recruitment. Finally, BOADICEA and IBIS predictive scores were not appreciably affected by limiting input data to family history for first-degree and second-degree relatives.

We aimed to develop a simple and reliable predictive model for HCC risk in these patients.
Patients and methods: A database of 1242 consecutive treatment-naive CHB patients who initially underwent ETV/TDF between February 2007 and January 2017 at four referral hospitals in South Korea was analyzed. The HCC risk model was constructed on the basis of a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model in the derivation dataset (n=944) and was validated using Harrell's C-statistic in a validation dataset (n=298).
Results: The 3/5-year cumulative incidence rates of HCC were 3.9/6.5 and 4.2/11.6% in the derivation and the validation dataset, respectively (P=0.08). In the derivation dataset, we identified four factors associated with HCC, namely, age, albumin, sex, and liver cirrhosis. The AASL (age, albumin, sex, liver cirrhosis)-HCC scoring system was developed on the basis of these factors, and simplified to an integer scoring system. AASL-HCC scores were found to have high discriminating performance for the prediction of HCC development at 5 years in the derivation (C-statistics=0.802, 95% confidence interval: 0.716-0.888) and validation dataset (C-statistics=0.805, 95% confidence interval: 0.671-0.939). When AASL-HCC scores were classified as 5 or less, 6-19, and at least 20 (low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups, respectively), the 5-year cumulative incidence rates of HCC were 0, 4.2, and 17.6%, respectively, in the derivation dataset.

Algorithmically assessed measures of BPE offer a more precise and reproducible means of measuring BPE than human readers and thus might improve the predictive performance of future cancer development.
Purpose: To determine if algorithmically extracted imaging features of BPE on screening breast MRI in high-risk women are associated with subsequent development of cancer.
Study type: Case-control study.
Population: In all, 133 women at high risk for developing breast cancer; 46 of these patients developed breast cancer subsequently over a follow-up period of 2 years.
Field strength/sequence: 5 T or 3.0 T T1 -weighted precontrast fat-saturated and nonfat-saturated sequences and postcontrast nonfat-saturated sequences.
Assessment: Automatic features of BPE were extracted with a computer algorithm. Subjective BPE scores from five breast radiologists (blinded to clinical outcomes) were also available.
Statistical tests: Leave-one-out crossvalidation for a multivariate logistic regression model developed using the automatic features and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were performed to calculate the area under the curve (AUC). Comparison of automatic features and subjective features was performed using a generalized regression model and the P-value was obtained. Odds ratios for automatic and subjective features were compared.
Results: The multivariate model discriminated patients who developed cancer from the patients who did not, with an AUC of 0.70 (95% confidence interval: 0.60-0.79, P < 0.001). The imaging features remained independently predictive of subsequent development of cancer (P < 0.003) when compared with the subjective BPE assessment of the readers.
Data conclusion: Automatically extracted BPE measurements may potentially be used to further stratify risk in patients undergoing high-risk screening MRI.

We extend the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) risk model to incorporate the effects of polygenic risk scores (PRS) and other risk factors (RFs).
Methods: BOADICEA incorporates the effects of truncating variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2, and ATM; a PRS based on 313 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) explaining 20% of BC polygenic variance; a residual polygenic component accounting for other genetic/familial effects; known lifestyle/hormonal/reproductive RFs; and mammographic density, while allowing for missing information.
Results: Among all factors considered, the predicted UK BC risk distribution is widest for the PRS, followed by mammographic density. The highest BC risk stratification is achieved when all genetic and lifestyle/hormonal/reproductive/anthropomorphic factors are considered jointly. With all factors, the predicted lifetime risks for women in the UK population vary from 2.8% for the 1st percentile to 30.6% for the 99th percentile, with 14.7% of women predicted to have a lifetime risk of 鈮17-<30% (moderate risk according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE] guidelines) and 1.1% a lifetime risk of 鈮30% (high risk).
Conclusion: This comprehensive model should enable high levels of BC risk stratification in the general population and women with family history, and facilitate individualized, informed decision-making on prevention therapies and screening."

Cox proportional hazard models were used to model time until disease onset. The sample was randomly divided into discovery (n = 1,469) and replication (n = 1,455) samples. In the replication sample, concordance was computed to indicate predictive accuracy and risk scores were calculated using the linear predictions. Youden index was used to identify high-risk versus low-risk patients and cumulative lung cancer incidence was examined for high-risk and low-risk groups. Multivariable analyses identified a combination of clinical and radiologic predictors for incident lung cancer including ln-age, ln-pack-years smoking, a history of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and several radiologic markers including spiculation, ground glass opacity, and nodule size. The final model reliably detected patients who developed lung cancer in the replication sample (C = 0.86, sensitivity/specificity = 0.73/0.81). Cumulative incidence of lung cancer was elevated in high-risk versus low-risk groups [HR = 14.34; 95% confidence interval (CI), 8.17-25.18].

Aim: This study aimed to determine the 5-year and the general life-time risk of breast cancer and also to determine breast cancer predictors in women using the Gail model. Methods: We used the Gail model to estimate the risk of breast cancer in female Turkish outpatients aged above 35 years in this cross-sectional study. Age, life-style habits, breast-feeding duration, family history of breast cancer, and body mass index were compared between high and low-risk subjects. We have performed the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) tools on patients regarding depression and anxiety. We also assessed the association of these covariates with the estimated risk of breast cancer in multivariate linear regression analysis. Results: We enrolled 1065 subjects with a mean age of 52.9 卤 8.4 years. The mean of the five-year risk for breast cancer was 1.33%卤0.6. Meanwhile, the mean of lifetime risks for breast cancer was 10.15%卤3.18, respectively. Nearly one-third of the participants had one child, 55.9% had breast-fed their children more than six months. Meanwhile, 18.5% of the subjects had a high depression score, 15.2% had a high anxiety score. Higher age, age at first birth, and parity; lower age at menarche; presence of menopause and family history of breast cancer were higher in the high-risk group. Higher age, and age at first birth; lower age at menarche; family history of breast cancer, presence of menopause, and parity were independently associated with higher breast cancer risk. Conclusion: We identified certain risk factors for breast cancer in our study population and Gail model is a reliable and useful breast cancer risk prediction model for clinical decision-making. This study contributes to the body of evidence in order to facilitate early detection and better plan for possible malignancies in Turkish population."

We aimed to develop a prediction model for pancreatic cancer based on changes in health captured by healthcare claims data.
Methods: We conducted a case-control study on 29,646 Medicare-enrolled patients aged 68 years and above with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) reported to the Surveillance Epidemiology an End Results (SEER) tumor registries program in 2004-2011 and 88,938 age and sex-matched controls. We developed a prediction model using multivariable logistic regression on Medicare claims for 16 risk factors and pre-diagnostic symptoms of PDAC present within 15 months prior to PDAC diagnosis. Claims within 3 months of PDAC diagnosis were excluded in sensitivity analyses. We evaluated the discriminatory power of the model with the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and performed cross-validation by bootstrapping.
Results: The prediction model on all cases and controls reached AUC of 0.68. Excluding the final 3 months of claims lowered the AUC to 0.58. Among new-onset diabetes patients, the prediction model reached AUC of 0.73, which decreased to 0.63 when claims from the final 3 months were excluded. Performance measures of the prediction models was confirmed by internal validation using the bootstrap method.
Conclusion: Models based on healthcare claims for clinical risk factors, symptoms and signs of pancreatic cancer are limited in classifying those who go on to diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and those who do not, especially when excluding claims that immediately precede the diagnosis of PDAC."

Breast cancer risk prediction models used in clinical practice have low discriminatory accuracy (0.53-0.64). Machine learning (ML) offers an alternative approach to standard prediction modeling that may address current limitations and improve accuracy of those tools. The purpose of this study was to compare the discriminatory accuracy of ML-based estimates against a pair of established methods-the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) and Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) models.
Methods: We quantified and compared the performance of eight different ML methods to the performance of BCRAT and BOADICEA using eight simulated datasets and two retrospective samples: a random population-based sample of U.S. breast cancer patients and their cancer-free female relatives (N = 1143), and a clinical sample of Swiss breast cancer patients and cancer-free women seeking genetic evaluation and/or testing (N = 2481).
Results: Predictive accuracy (AU-ROC curve) reached 88.28% using ML-Adaptive Boosting and 88.89% using ML-random forest versus 62.40% with BCRAT for the U.S. population-based sample. Predictive accuracy reached 90.17% using ML-adaptive boosting and 89.32% using ML-Markov chain Monte Carlo generalized linear mixed model versus 59.31% with BOADICEA for the Swiss clinic-based sample.
Conclusions: There was a striking improvement in the accuracy of classification of women with and without breast cancer achieved with ML algorithms compared to the state-of-the-art model-based approaches. High-accuracy prediction techniques are important in personalized medicine because they facilitate stratification of prevention strategies and individualized clinical management."

Use of a simple, validated risk prediction tool will offer a low-cost mechanism to identify the high-risk individuals for CRC. This will increase efficient use of limited resources and early identification of patients. The aim of our study was to develop and validate a risk prediction model for developing CRC for Sri Lankan adults.
Methods: The risk predictors were based on the risk factors identified through a logistic regression model along with expert opinion. A case control design utilizing 65 CRC new cases and 65 hospital controls aged 30 years or more was used to assess the criterion validity and reliability of the model. The information was obtained using an interviewer administered questionnaire based on the risk prediction model.
Results: The developed model consisted of eight predictors with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.849 (95% CI: 0.8 to 0.9, P<0.001). It has a sensitivity of 76.9%, specificity of 83.1%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 82.0%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 79.3%. Positive and negative likelihood ratios are 4.6 and 0.3. Test re-test reliability revealed a Kappa coefficient of 0.88.
Conclusions: The model developed to predict the risk of CRC among adults aged 30 years and above was proven to be valid and reliable and it is an effective tool to be used as the first step to identify the high-risk population who should be referred for colonoscopy examination."

Fifty candidate SNPs were selected to explore the associations with CRC in a discovery sample with 1002 CRC cases and 999 healthy controls. We modeled the significant SNPs identified by the case-control study as a multilocus weighted GRS and estimated the association of GRS with CRC. Furthermore, 300 pairs of cases and controls were included as a validation sample to confirm the finding. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to evaluate the predictive power of GRS in CRC. A total of seven SNPs were found to increase the risk of CRC, and two SNPs were found to be negatively associated with CRC in the discovery sample. Relative to participants with the lowest quartile of GRS, those with the highest quartile had a 2.64-fold (95% CI: 1.99-3.51) higher risk for CRC. For every 0.1 point of GRS increase, the risk of CRC increase by 11% (95% CI: 8-14%). AUROC for GRS alone were 0.59 (95% CI: 0.57-0.62) and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.46-0.58) in the discovery and validation sample, respectively.

Objectives: To develop and internally validate a prediction model to calculate the absolute risk of a first KC in patients with AK.
Methods: The risk-prediction model was based on the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study cohort. We hereto analysed the data of participants with at least one AK lesion at cohort baseline using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model and included 13 a priori defined candidate predictor variables considering phenotypic, genetic and lifestyle risk factors. KCs were identified by linkage of the data with the Dutch Pathology Registry.
Results: Of the 1169 AK participants at baseline, 176 (15路1%) developed a KC after a median follow-up of 1路8 years. The final model with significant predictors was obtained after backward stepwise selection and comprised the presence of four to nine AKs [hazard ratio (HR) 1路68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1路17-2路42], 10 or more AKs (HR 2路44, 95% CI 1路65-3路61), AK localization on the upper extremities (HR 0路75, 95% CI 0路52-1路08) or elsewhere except the head (HR 1路40, 95% CI 0路98-2路01) and coffee consumption (HR 0路92, 95% CI 0路84-1路01). Evaluation of the discriminative ability of the model showed a bootstrap validated concordance index (c-index) of 0路60.
Conclusions: We showed that the risk of KC in patients with AK can be calculated with the use of four easily assessable predictor variables.

It uses an internal switching algorithm, based on a woman's risk factor data, to estimate her absolute BC risk using either the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study (IBIS) version 7.02, or Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm version 3 models, and then provides tailored risk management information. This study assessed the accuracy of the 10-year risk estimates using prospective data.
Methods: iPrevent-assigned 10-year invasive BC risk was calculated for 15 732 women aged 20-70 years and without BC at recruitment to the Prospective Family Study Cohort. Calibration, the ratio of the expected (E) number of BCs to the observed (O) number and discriminatory accuracy were assessed.
Results: During the 10 years of follow-up, 619 women (3.9%) developed BC compared with 702 expected (E/O = 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.05 to 1.23). For women younger than 50 years, 50 years and older, and BRCA1/2-mutation carriers and noncarriers, E/O was 1.04 (95% CI = 0.93 to 1.16), 1.24 (95% CI = 1.11 to 1.39), 1.13 (95% CI = 0.96 to 1.34), and 1.13 (95% CI = 1.04 to 1.24), respectively. The C-statistic was 0.70 (95% CI = 0.68 to 0.73) overall and 0.74 (95% CI = 0.71 to 0.77), 0.63 (95% CI = 0.59 to 0.66), 0.59 (95% CI = 0.53 to 0.64), and 0.65 (95% CI = 0.63 to 0.68), respectively, for the subgroups above. Applying the newer IBIS version 8.0b in the iPrevent switching algorithm improved calibration overall (E/O = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.15) and in all subgroups, without changing discriminatory accuracy.
Conclusions: For 10-year BC risk, iPrevent had good discriminatory accuracy overall and was well calibrated for women aged younger than 50 years. Calibration may be improved in the future by incorporating IBIS version 8.0b."

First-degree family history, often simplified as a dichotomous or three-level categorical variable (0/1/>1) based on number of affected relatives, is an important risk factor for many conditions. However, detailed family structure information such as the total number of first-degree relatives, and for each, their current or death age, and age at diagnosis are also important for risk prediction.
Methods: We develop a family history score under a Bayesian framework, based on first-degree family structure. We tested performance of the proposed score using data from a large prospective cohort study of women with a first-degree breast cancer family history. We used likelihood ratio tests to evaluate whether the proposed score added additional information to a Cox model with known breast cancer risk factors and the three-level family history variable. We also compared prediction performance through Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and goodness-of-fit testing.
Results: Our proposed Bayesian family history score improved fit compared to the commonly used three-level family history score, both without and with adjustment for other risk factors (likelihood ratio tests p = 0.003 without adjustment for other risk factors, and p = 0.007 and 0.009 under adjustment with two candidate sets of risk factors). AUCs of ROC curves for the two models were similar, though in all cases were higher after addition of the BFHS.
Conclusions: Capturing detailed family history data through the proposed family history score can improve risk assessment and prediction. Such approaches could enable better-targeted personalized screening schedules and prevention strategies."

By training a deep neural network, further information in the mammographic images can be considered. Purpose To develop a risk score that is associated with future breast cancer and compare it with density-based models. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, all women aged 40-74 years within the Karolinska University Hospital uptake area in whom breast cancer was diagnosed in 2013-2014 were included along with healthy control subjects. Network development was based on cases diagnosed from 2008 to 2012. The deep learning (DL) risk score, dense area, and percentage density were calculated for the earliest available digital mammographic examination for each woman. Logistic regression models were fitted to determine the association with subsequent breast cancer. False-negative rates were obtained for the DL risk score, age-adjusted dense area, and age-adjusted percentage density. Results A total of 2283 women, 278 of whom were later diagnosed with breast cancer, were evaluated. The age at mammography (mean, 55.7 years vs 54.6 years; P < .001), the dense area (mean, 38.2 cm2 vs 34.2 cm2; P < .001), and the percentage density (mean, 25.6% vs 24.0%; P < .001) were higher among women diagnosed with breast cancer than in those without a breast cancer diagnosis. The odds ratios and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were higher for age-adjusted DL risk score than for dense area and percentage density: 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48, 1.64; AUC, 0.65), 1.31 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.38; AUC, 0.60), and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.25; AUC, 0.57), respectively (P < .001 for AUC). The false-negative rate was lower: 31% (95% CI: 29%, 34%), 36% (95% CI: 33%, 39%; P = .006), and 39% (95% CI: 37%, 42%; P < .001); this difference was most pronounced for more aggressive cancers.

We aimed to develop simple models estimating HCC risk in patients with alcohol-related liver disease (ALD)-cirrhosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-cirrhosis and calculate the net benefit that would be derived by implementing HCC surveillance strategies based on HCC risk as predicted by our models.
Methods: We identified 7,068 patients with NAFLD-cirrhosis and 16,175 with ALD-cirrhosis who received care in the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system in 2012. We retrospectively followed them for the development of incident HCC until January 2018. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to develop and internally validate models predicting HCC risk using baseline characteristics at entry into the cohort in 2012. We plotted decision curves of net benefit against HCC screening thresholds.
Results: We identified 1,278 incident cases of HCC during a mean follow-up period of 3.7 years. Mean annualized HCC incidence was 1.56% in NAFLD-cirrhosis and 1.44% in ALD-cirrhosis. The final models estimating HCC were developed separately for NAFLD-cirrhosis and ALD-cirrhosis and included 7 predictors: age, gender, diabetes, body mass index, platelet count, serum albumin and aspartate aminotransferase to 鈭歛lanine aminotransferase ratio. The models exhibited very good measures of discrimination and calibration and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75 for NAFLD-cirrhosis and 0.76 for ALD-cirrhosis. Decision curves showed higher standardized net benefit of risk-based screening using our prediction models compared to the screen-all approach.
Conclusions: We developed simple models estimating HCC risk in patients with NAFLD-cirrhosis or ALD-cirrhosis, which are available as web-based tools (www.hccrisk.com). Risk stratification can be used to inform risk-based HCC surveillance strategies in individual patients or healthcare systems or to identify high-risk patients for clinical trials.
Lay summary: Patients with cirrhosis of the liver are at risk of getting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC or liver cancer) and therefore it is recommended that they undergo surveillance for HCC. However, the risk of HCC varies dramatically in patients with cirrhosis, which has implications on if and how patients get surveillance, how providers counsel patients about the need for surveillance, and how healthcare systems approach and prioritize surveillance. We used readily available predictors to develop models estimating HCC risk in patients with cirrhosis, which are available as web-based tools at www.hccrisk.com."

Because of substantial interobserver variability in the application of the BI-RADS lexicon, the decision to biopsy varies greatly and results in overdiagnosis and excessive biopsies. The false-positive rate from mammograms is estimated to be 7% to approximately 10% overall, but within the BI-RADS 4 category, it is greater than 70%. Therefore, we developed the Breast Cancer Risk Calculator (BRISK) to target a well-characterized and specific patient subgroup (BI-RADS 4) rather than a broad heterogeneous group in assessing breast cancer risk.
Methods: BRISK provides a novel precise risk assessment model to reduce overdiagnosis and unnecessary biopsies. It was developed by applying natural language processing and deep learning methods on 5,147 patient records archived in the Houston Methodist systemwide data warehouse from 2006 to May 2015, including imaging and pathology reports, mammographic images, and patient demographics. Key characteristics for BI-RADS 4 patients were collected and computed to output an index measure for biopsy recommendation that is clinically relevant and informative and improves upon the traditional BI-RADS 4 scores.
Results: For the validation set, we assessed data from 1,247 BI-RADS 4 patients, including mammographic images and medical reports. The BRISK model sensitivity to predict malignancy was 100%, whereas the specificity was 74%. The total accuracy of our implemented model in BRISK was 81%. Overall area under the curve was 0.93.
Conclusion: BRISK for abnormal mammogram uses integrative artificial intelligence technology and has demonstrated high sensitivity in the prediction of malignancy. Prospective evaluation is under way and can lead to improvement in patient-physician engagement in making informed decisions with regard to biopsy."

Early detection of individuals at risk of lung cancer is critical to reduce the mortality rate.
Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a prospective risk prediction model to identify patients at risk of new incident lung cancer within the next 1 year in the general population.
Methods: Data from individual patient electronic health records (EHRs) were extracted from the Maine Health Information Exchange network. The study population consisted of patients with at least one EHR between April 1, 2016, and March 31, 2018, who had no history of lung cancer. A retrospective cohort (N=873,598) and a prospective cohort (N=836,659) were formed for model construction and validation. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was adopted to build the model. It assigned a score to each individual to quantify the probability of a new incident lung cancer diagnosis from October 1, 2016, to September 31, 2017. The model was trained with the clinical profile in the retrospective cohort from the preceding 6 months and validated with the prospective cohort to predict the risk of incident lung cancer from April 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018.
Results: The model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.881 (95% CI 0.873-0.889) in the prospective cohort. Two thresholds of 0.0045 and 0.01 were applied to the predictive scores to stratify the population into low-, medium-, and high-risk categories. The incidence of lung cancer in the high-risk category (579/53,922, 1.07%) was 7.7 times higher than that in the overall cohort (1167/836,659, 0.14%). Age, a history of pulmonary diseases and other chronic diseases, medications for mental disorders, and social disparities were found to be associated with new incident lung cancer.

Methods: This was a nationwide Swedish population-based, case-control study, including 167 new cases of ESCC and 820 randomly selected control participants. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were assessed by using multivariable unconditional logistic regression. The discriminative accuracy of the model was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with leave-1-out cross validation. Models for projecting individuals' absolute 5-year risk of ESCC were developed by incorporating the age-specific and sex-specific incidence rates and competing risk of death from other causes.
Results: A model including the risk factors age, sex, tobacco smoking, alcohol overconsumption, education, duration of living with a partner, and place of residence during childhood generated an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.84). A model based only on age, sex, tobacco smoking, and alcohol overconsumption obtained a similar AUC (0.79; 95% CI, 0.75-0.82). A 5-year follow-up of 355 men aged 70 to 74 years with over 35 years' smoking and alcohol overconsumption history is needed to detect 1 ESCC case.

Methods: Case-control design and multinomial logistic regression were used to develop models to estimate the risk of glioma development while accounting for histologic and molecular subtypes. Case-case design and logistic regression were used to develop models to predict isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status. A total of 1273 glioma cases and 443 controls from Mayo Clinic were used in the discovery set, and 852 glioma cases and 231 controls from UCSF were used in the validation set. All samples were genotyped using a custom Illumina OncoArray.
Results: Patients in the highest 5% of the risk score had more than a 14-fold increase in relative risk of developing an IDH mutant glioma. Large differences in lifetime absolute risk were observed at the extremes of the risk score percentile. For both IDH mutant 1p/19q non-codeleted glioma and IDH mutant 1p/19q codeleted glioma, the lifetime risk increased from almost null to 2.3% and almost null to 1.7%, respectively. The SNP-based model that predicted IDH mutation status had a validation concordance index of 0.85.

Methods: We used data from 40,158 women aged 50-69 years (via the lifepool cohort) participating in Australia's BreastScreen programme. We investigated the association between Gail scores and future invasive breast cancer, comparing observed and expected outcomes by Gail score ranked groups. We also used machine learning to rank Gail model input variables by importance and then assessed the incremental benefit in risk prediction obtained by adding variables in order of diminishing importance.
Results: Over a median of 4.3 years, the Gail model predicted 612 invasive breast cancers compared with 564 observed cancers (expected/observed (E/O) = 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.18). There was good agreement across decile groups of Gail scores (蠂2 = 7.1, p = 0.6) although there was some overestimation of cancer risk in the top decile of our study group (E/O = 1.65, 95% CI 1.33-2.07). Women in the highest quintile (Q5) of Gail scores had a 2.28-fold increased risk of breast cancer (95% CI 1.73-3.02, p < 0.0001) compared with the lowest quintile (Q1). Compared with the median quintile, women in Q5 had a 34% increased risk (95% CI 1.06-1.70, p = 0.014) and those in Q1 had a 41% reduced risk (95% CI 0.44-0.79, p < 0.0001). Similar patterns were observed separately for women aged 50-59 and 60-69 years. The model's overall discrimination was modest (area under the curve (AUC) 0.59, 95% CI 0.56-0.61). A reduced Gail model excluding information on ethnicity and hyperplasia was comparable to the full Gail model in terms of correctly stratifying women into risk groups.
Conclusions: This study confirms that the Gail model (or a reduced model excluding information on hyperplasia and ethnicity) can effectively stratify a screened population aged 50-69 years according to the risk of future invasive breast cancer. This information has the potential to enable more personalised, risk-based screening strategies that aim to improve the balance of the benefits and harms of screening."

Aim: To construct and internally validate two sequential tests for early prediction of liver cancer. These tests enable an algorithm which could improve the performance of the standard surveillance protocol recommended (imaging with or without AFP), limited to patients with cirrhosis.
Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis in prospectively collected specimens from an ongoing cohort. We designed an early sensitive high-risk test (LCR1) that combined (using Cox model) hepatoprotective proteins (apolipoproteinA1, haptoglobin) with known risk factors (gender, age, gammaglutamyltranspeptidase), and a marker of fibrosis (alpha2-macroglobulin). To increase the specificity, we then combined (LCR2) these components with alpha-fetoprotein.
Results: A total of 9892 patients, 85.9% without cirrhosis, were followed up for 5.9 years [IQR: 4.3-9.4]. LCR1 and LCR2 time-dependent AUROCs were not different in construction and validation randomised subsets. Among 2027 patients with high-LCR1 then high-LCR2, 167 cancers (113 with cirrhosis, 54 without cirrhosis) were detected, that is 12 patients needed to screen one cancer. The negative predictive value was 99.5% (95% CI 99.0-99.7) in the 2026 not screened patients (11 cancers without cirrhosis) higher than the standard surveillance, which detected 113 cancers in 755 patients screened, that is seven patients needed to screen one cancer, but with a lower negative predictive value 98.0% (97.5-98.5; Z = 4.3; P < 0.001) in 3298 not screened patients (42 cancers without cirrhosis).

Updating these tools using more specific outcome measures and contemporary predictors could potentially lead to further reductions. Our objective was to assess clinical impact of the 4 kallikrein (4K) score, the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator (RPCRC), and the combination of both for predicting csCaP based on the latest International Society of Urological Pathology grading system and cribriform growth pattern.
Materials and methods: Our prospective cohort consisted of 2,872 men from the first screening round in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Rotterdam; biopsy indication PSA 鈮 3.0. The predictive performance of the 4Kscore, RPCRC, and the combination of RPCRC with 4Kscore were assessed with area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration plots. Decision curve analysis was used to evaluate the reduction of unnecessary biopsy and indolent CaP.
Results: The csCaP was present in 242 (8%) men, and indolent CaP in 578 (20%). The 4Kscore and RPCRC had similar high AUCs (0.88 vs. 0.87; P = 0.41). The 4Kscore-RPCRC combination improved AUC to 0.89 compared to 4Kscore (P < 0.01) and RPCRC (P < 0.01). The RPCRC and 4Kscore reduced the number of Bx with 42 and 44, respectively, per 100 men at risk compared to a 鈮PSA 3.0 strategy without increasing missed csCaP. The RPCRC-4Kscore combination resulted in a slight additional net reduction of 3.3 biopsies per 100 men.
Conclusions: The RPCRC and 4Kscore had similar reductions of unnecessary biopsies and overdiagnosis of indolent disease. Combination of both models slightly reduced unnecessary biopsies further. Gain in net benefit must, however, be weighed against additional costs and availability of tests."

Type of haematuria and age-specific thresholds are frequently used to guide referral for the investigation of haematuria.
Objectives: To develop and externally validate the haematuria cancer risk score (HCRS) to improve patient selection for the investigation of haematuria.
Methods: Development cohort comprise of 3539 prospectively recruited patients recruited at 40 UK hospitals (DETECT 1; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02676180) and validation cohort comprise of 656 Swiss patients. All patients were aged >18 years and referred to hospital for the evaluation of visible and nonvisible haematuria. Sensitivity and specificity of the HCRS in the validation cohort were derived from a cut-off identified from the discovery cohort.
Results: Patient age, gender, type of haematuria and smoking history were used to develop the HCRS. HCRS validation achieves good discrimination (AUC 0.835; 95% CI: 0.789-0.880) and calibration (calibration slope = 1.215) with no significant overfitting (P = 0.151). The HCRS detected 11.4% (n = 8) more cancers which would be missed by UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines. The American Urological Association guidelines would identify all cancers with a specificity of 12.6% compared to 30.5% achieved by the HCRS. All patients with upper tract cancers would have been identified.

Elastic net regression with cross-validation was performed and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to evaluate ability to predict breast cancer. We also compared our anatomy-augmented features to current state-of-the-art in which parenchymal texture was assessed without considering breast anatomy and evaluated the added value of the extracted features to breast density, body-mass-index (BMI) and age as baseline predictors. Our anatomy-augmented texture features resulted in higher discriminatory capacity (AUC = 0.63 vs. AUC = 0.59) when breast anatomy was not considered (p = 0.021), with dense tissue regions and the central breast quadrant being more heavily weighted. Texture also improved baseline models (from AUC = 0.62 to AUC = 0.67, p = 0.029).

Methods: We used prospectively collected data from 8040 consecutive unscreened patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2006 and 2016. Of these, data from 2799 patients with Gleason 3 + 3 on biopsy were used to develop a multivariate model predicting the presence of insignificant PC at radical prostatectomy (ERSPC updated definition3: Gleason 3 + 3 only, index tumour volume < 1.3 cm3 and total tumour volume < 2.5 cm3). This was used to develop a novel risk score (NRS) which was validated in an equivalent independent cohort (n = 441). We compared the accuracy of existing predictive tools and the NRS in these cohorts.
Results: The NRS (incorporating PSA, prostate volume, age, clinical T Stage, percent and number of positive biopsy cores) outperformed pre-existing predictive tools in derivation and validation cohorts (AUC 0.755 and 0.76, respectively). Selection bias due to analysis of a surgical cohort is acknowledged.

Here we describe cSCCscore, a prediction tool that uses patients' covariates and clinical histories to assign them personal probabilities of developing cSCCs within 3 years after risk assessment. cSCCscore uses a statistical model for the occurrence and timing of a patient's cSCCs, whose parameters we estimated using cohort data from 66,995 patients in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California healthcare system. We found that patients' covariates and histories explained approximately 75% of their interpersonal cSCC risk variation. Using cross-validated performance measures, we also found cSCCscore's predictions to be moderately well calibrated to the patients' observed cSCC incidence. Moreover, cSCCscore discriminated well between patients who subsequently did and did not develop a new primary cSCC within 3 years after risk assignment, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of approximately 85%. Thus, cSCCscore can facilitate more informed management of non-Hispanic white patients at cSCC risk. cSCCscore's predictions are available at https://researchapps.github.io/cSCCscore/."

We aimed to use a combination of potential predictors including imaging tests to quantify the risk of pancreatic cancer and evaluate its utility.
Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who were suspected as having pancreatic cancer and underwent biopsy examination of pancreatic mass at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016. We retrieved data on demographics, clinical history, imaging tests, and final pancreatic diagnosis from medical records.
Results: Of the 206 who underwent pancreatic biopsies, the mean age was 63.6 years; 54.4% were male. Of all the biopsies, 57.8% were malignant and 42.2% were benign masses. Nine factors contributed significantly to the risk of pancreatic cancer and were noted: older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] =1.048; P=0.010), male gender (aOR =4.670; P=0.008), weight loss (aOR =14.810; P=0.001), abdominal pain (aOR =7.053; P=0.0.001), blood clots (aOR =20.787; P=0.014), pancreatitis (aOR =4.473; P=0.021), jaundice (aOR =7.446; P=0.003), persistent fatigue (aOR =22.015; P=0.015), and abnormal imaging tests (aOR =67.124; P=0.001).

One way of accomplishing this might be to simplify the information that users of risk prediction tools have to enter, but it is critical to ensure no resulting detrimental effects on model performance. We compared the performance of a simplified, largely categorized exposure-based colon cancer risk model against a more complex, largely continuous exposure-based risk model using two prospective cohorts. Using data from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study we included 816 incident colon cancer cases in women and 412 in men. The discrimination of models was not significantly different comparing a categorized risk prediction model with a continuous prediction model in women (c-statistic 0.600 vs. 0.609, P diff = 0.07) and men (c-statistic 0.622 vs. 0.618, P diff = 0.60). Both models had good calibration in men [observed case count/expected case count (O/E) = 1.05, P > 0.05] but not in women (O/E = 1.19, P < 0.01). Risk reclassification was slightly improved using categorized predictors in men [net reclassification index (NRI) = 0.041] and slightly worsened in women (NRI = -0.065).

We hypothesized that qualitative changes of lipoproteins are associated with the risk for CRC development. This study analyses low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) diameters, as well as distribution of LDL and HDL subclasses in patients with CRC, with an aim to determine whether advanced lipid testing might be useful in predicting the risk for the onset of this malignancy.
Materials and methods: This case-control study included 84 patients with newly diagnosed CRC and 92 controls. Gradient gel electrophoresis was applied for separation of lipoprotein subclasses and for LDL and HDL diameters determination. Lipid parameters were measured using routine enzymatic methods.
Results: Total cholesterol, HDL and LDL-cholesterol were significantly lower in CRC patients compared to controls (4.47 mmol/L vs. 5.63 mmol/L; 0.99 mmol/L vs. 1.27 mmol/L; 2.90 mmol/L vs. 3.66 mmol/L; P < 0.001, respectively). Patients had significantly smaller LDL (25.14 nm vs. 26.92 nm; P < 0.001) and HDL diameters (8.76 nm vs. 10.17 nm; P < 0.001) and greater proportion of small, dense LDL particles (54.0% vs. 52.9%; P = 0.044) than controls. Decreased LDL and HDL diameters were independent predictors of CRC (OR = 0.5, P = 0.001 and OR = 0.5, P = 0.008, respectively), and alongside with age and HDL-cholesterol concentrations formed the optimal cost-effective model, providing adequate discriminative abilities for CRC (AUC = 0.89) and correct patients classification (81%).
Conclusions: Patients with CRC have decreased LDL and HDL diameters and increased proportion of smaller particles. LDL and HDL diameters determination could be useful in assessing the risk for CRC development."

Being based onto parameters commonly assessed in the initial evaluation of men ""prostate health,"" these novel nomograms could represent a valuable and easy-to-use tool for physicians to help patients to understand their risk of harboring PCa and CSPCa."

Materials and Methods Computerized image analysis was used to quantify breast density and extract parenchymal texture features in a cross-sectional sample of women screened with digital mammography from September 1, 2012, to February 28, 2013 (n = 2029; age range, 35-75 years; mean age, 55.9 years). Unsupervised clustering was applied to identify and reproduce phenotypes of parenchymal complexity in separate training (n = 1339) and test sets (n = 690). Differences across phenotypes by age, body mass index, breast density, and estimated breast cancer risk were assessed by using Fisher exact, 蠂2, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate preliminary associations between the detected phenotypes and breast cancer in an independent case-control sample (76 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 158 control participants) matched on age. Results Unsupervised clustering in the screening sample identified four phenotypes with increasing parenchymal complexity that were reproducible between training and test sets (P = .001). Breast density was not strongly correlated with phenotype category (R2 = 0.24 for linear trend). The low- to intermediate-complexity phenotype (prevalence, 390 of 2029 [19%]) had the lowest proportion of dense breasts (eight of 390 [2.1%]), whereas similar proportions were observed across other phenotypes (from 140 of 291 [48.1%] in the high-complexity phenotype to 275 of 511 [53.8%] in the low-complexity phenotype). In the independent case-control sample, phenotypes showed a significant association with breast cancer (P = .001), resulting in higher discriminatory capacity when added to a model with breast density and body mass index (area under the curve, 0.84 vs 0.80; P = .03 for comparison). Conclusion Radiomic phenotypes capture mammographic parenchymal complexity beyond conventional breast density measures and established breast cancer risk factors. 漏 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

We aimed to predict the risk of prostate cancer based on prostate specific antigen together with single nucleotide polymorphism information.
Materials and methods: We performed a prospective study of 20,575 men with prostate specific antigen testing and 4,967 with a polygenic risk score for prostate cancer based on 66 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the Finnish population based screening trial of prostate cancer and 5,269 samples of 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the Finnish prostate cancer DNA study. A Bayesian predictive model was built to estimate the risk of prostate cancer by sequentially combining genetic information with prostate specific antigen compared with prostate specific antigen alone in study subjects limited to those with prostate specific antigen 4 ng/ml or above.
Results: The posterior odds of prostate cancer based on 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms together with the prostate specific antigen level ranged from 3.7 at 4 ng/ml, 14.2 at 6 and 40.7 at 8 to 98.2 at 10 ng/ml. The ROC AUC was elevated to 88.8% (95% CI 88.6-89.1) for prostate specific antigen combined with the risk score based on 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms compared with 70.1% (95% CI 69.6-70.7) for prostate specific antigen alone. It was further escalated to 96.7% (95% CI 96.5-96.9) when all prostate cancer susceptibility polygenes were combined.
Conclusions: Expedient use of multiple genetic variants together with information on prostate specific antigen levels better predicts the risk of prostate cancer than prostate specific antigen alone and allows for higher prostate specific antigen cutoffs. Combined information also provides a basis for risk stratification which can be used to optimize the performance of prostate cancer screening."

Pylori, Omp, And Hp0305",in recent 10 years,2018,Asia,China,Gastric Cancer,"Background: Helicobacter pylori is the leading cause of gastric cancer, yet the majority of infected individuals will not develop neoplasia. Previously, we developed and replicated serologic H. pylori biomarkers for gastric cancer risk among prospective cohorts in East Asia and now seek to validate the performance of these biomarkers in identifying individuals with premalignant lesions.
Methods: This cross-sectional study included 1,402 individuals from Linqu County screened by upper endoscopy. H. pylori protein-specific antibody levels were assessed using multiplex serology. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for prevalent intestinal metaplasia, indefinite dysplasia, or dysplasia, compared with superficial or mild atrophic gastritis.
Results: Compared with individuals seronegative to Omp and HP0305, individuals seropositive to both were seven times more likely to have precancerous lesions (OR, 7.43; 95% CI, 5.59-9.88). A classification model for precancerous lesions that includes age, smoking, and seropositivity to H. pylori, Omp, and HP0305 resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.751 (95% CI, 0.725-0.777), which is significantly better than the same model, including the established gastric cancer risk factor CagA (AUC, 0.718; 95% CI, 0.691-0.746, P difference = 0.0002).
Conclusions: The present study of prevalent precancerous gastric lesions provides support for two new serum biomarkers of gastric cancer risk, Omp and HP 0305.
Impact: Our results support further research into the serological biomarkers Omp and HP0305 as possible improvements over the established virulence marker CagA for identifying individuals with precancerous lesions in East Asia."

We aimed to develop models estimating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk after antiviral treatment.
Methods: We identified 45,810 patients who initiated antiviral treatment in the Veterans Affairs (VA) national healthcare system from 1/1/2009 to 12/31/2015, including 29,309 (64%) DAA-only regimens and 16,501 (36%) interferon 卤 DAA regimens. We retrospectively followed patients until 6/15/2017 to identify incident cases of HCC. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to develop and internally validate models predicting HCC risk using baseline characteristics at the time of antiviral treatment.
Results: We identified 1,412 incident cases of HCC diagnosed at least 180 days after initiation of antiviral treatment during a mean follow-up of 2.5 years (range 1.0-7.5 years). Models predicting HCC risk after antiviral treatment were developed and validated separately for four subgroups of patients: cirrhosis/SVR, cirrhosis/no SVR, no cirrhosis/SVR, no cirrhosis/no SVR. Four predictors (age, platelet count, serum aspartate aminotransferase/鈭歛lanine aminotransferase ratio and albumin) accounted for most of the models' predictive value, with smaller contributions from sex, race-ethnicity, HCV genotype, body mass index, hemoglobin and serum alpha-fetoprotein. Fitted models were well-calibrated with very good measures of discrimination. Decision curves demonstrated higher net benefit of using model-based HCC risk estimates to determine whether to recommend screening or not compared to the screen-all or screen-none strategies.
Conclusions: We developed and internally validated models that estimate HCC risk following antiviral treatment. These models are available as web-based tools that can be used to inform risk-based HCC surveillance strategies in individual patients.
Lay summary: Most patients with hepatitis C virus have been treated or will be treated with direct-acting antivirals. It is important that we can model the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in these patients, so that we develop the optimum screening strategy that avoids unnecessary screening, while adequately screening those at increased risk. Herein, we have developed and validated models that are available as web-based tools that can be used to guide screening strategies."

Multivariable risk stratification could also avoid unnecessary biopsies following multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).
Objective: To construct MRI-ERSPC-RCs for the prediction of any- and high-grade (Gleason score 鈮3 + 4) prostate cancer (PCa) in 12-core TRUS-Bx卤MRI-targeted biopsy (MRI-TBx) by adding Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) and age as parameters to the ERSPC-RC3 (biopsy-na茂ve men) and ERSPC-RC4 (previously biopsied men).
Design, setting, and participants: A total of 961 men received mpMRI and 12-core TRUS-Bx卤MRI-TBx (in case of PI-RADS 鈮3) in five institutions. Data of 504 biopsy-na茂ve and 457 previously biopsied men were used to adjust the ERSPC-RC3 and ERSPC-RC4.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Logistic regression models were constructed. The areas under the curve (AUCs) of the original ERSPC-RCs and MRI-ERSPC-RCs (including PI-RADS and age) for any- and high-grade PCa were compared. Decision curve analysis was performed to assess the clinical utility of the MRI-ERSPC-RCs.
Results and limitations: MRI-ERSPC-RC3 had a significantly higher AUC for high-grade PCa compared with the ERSPC-RC3: 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81-0.88) versus 0.76 (95% CI 0.71-0.80, p<0.01). Similarly, MRI-ERSPC-RC4 had a higher AUC for high-grade PCa compared with the ERSPC-RC4: 0.85 (95% CI 0.81-0.89) versus 0.74 (95% CI 0.69-0.79, p<0.01). Unlike for the MRI-ERSPC-RC3, decision curve analysis showed clear net benefit of the MRI-ERSPC-RC4 at a high-grade PCa risk threshold of 鈮5%. Using a 鈮10% high-grade PCa risk threshold to biopsy for the MRI-ERSPC-RC4, 36% biopsies are saved, missing low- and high-grade PCa, respectively, in 15% and 4% of men who are not biopsied.
Conclusions: We adjusted the ERSPC-RCs for the prediction of any- and high-grade PCa in 12-core TRUS-Bx卤MRI-TBx. Although the ability of the MRI-ERSPC-RC3 for biopsy-na茂ve men to avoid biopsies remains questionable, application of the MRI-ERSPC-RC4 in previously biopsied men in our cohort would have avoided 36% of biopsies, missing high-grade PCa in 4% of men who would not have received a biopsy.
Patient summary: We have constructed magnetic resonance imaging-based Rotterdam European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (MRI-ERSPC) risk calculators for prostate cancer prediction in transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy and MRI-targeted biopsy by incorporating age and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score into the original ERSPC risk calculators. The MRI-ERSPC risk calculator for previously biopsied men could be used to avoid one-third of biopsies following MRI."

We aimed to validate PAGE-B scores and THRI in Asian patients with CHB and suggested modified PAGE-B scores to improve the predictive performance.
Methods: From 2007 to 2017, we examined 3,001 Asian patients with CHB receiving entecavir/tenofovir therapy. We assessed the performances of PAGE-B, THRI, CU-HCC, GAG-HCC, and REACH-B for HCC development. A modified PAGE-B score (mPAGE-B) was developed (derivation set, n = 2,001) based on multivariable Cox models. Bootstrap for internal validation and external validation (validation set, n = 1,000) were performed.
Results: The five-year cumulative HCC incidence rates were 6.6% and 7.2% in the derivation and validation datasets after entecavir/tenofovir onset. In the derivation dataset, age, gender, serum albumin levels, and platelet counts were independently associated with HCC. The mPAGE-B score was developed based on age, gender, platelet counts, and serum albumin levels (time-dependent area under receiver operating characteristic curves [AUROC] = 0.82). In the validation set, the PAGE-B and THRI showed similar AUROCs to CU-HCC, GAG-HCC, and REACH-B at five years (0.72 and 0.73 vs. 0.70, 0.71, and 0.61 respectively; all p >0.05 except REACH-B), whereas the AUROC of mPAGE-B at five years was 0.82, significantly higher than the five other models (all p <0.01). HCC incidence rates after initiation of entecavir/tenofovir therapy in patients with CHB were significantly decreased in all risk groups in long-term follow-up periods.
Conclusion: Although PAGE-B and THRI are applicable in Asian patients with CHB receiving entecavir/tenofovir therapy, mPAGE-B scores including additional serum albumin levels showed better predictive performance than the PAGE-B score.
Lay summary: PAGE-B scores and Toronto HCC risk index were developed to predict the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Caucasian patients with CHB under potent antiviral therapy. This study validated these two scores in Asian patients with CHB and suggested that modified PAGE-B scores could improve the predictive performance. A modified PAGE-B score, which is based only on a patient's age, gender, baseline platelet counts, and serum albumin levels at treatment initiation, represents a reliable and easily available risk score to predict HCC development during the first five years of antiviral treatment in Asian patients with CHB. With a scoring range from 0 to 21 points, a modified PAGE-B score differentiates the HCC risk. A modified PAGE-B score significantly differentiates the five-year HCC risk: low 鈮8 points and high 鈮13 points."

Materials and methods: An institutional review board approved retrospective case-control study of 1474 mammographic images was performed in average risk women. First, 210 patients with new incidence of breast cancer were identified. Mammograms from these patients prior to developing breast cancer were identified and made up the case group [420 bilateral craniocaudal mammograms]. The control group consisted of 527 patients without breast cancer from the same time period. Prior mammograms from these patients made up the control group [1054 bilateral craniocaudal mammograms]. A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was designed for pixel-wise breast cancer risk prediction. Briefly, each mammogram was normalized as a map of z-scores and resized to an input image size of 256 脳 256. Then a contracting and expanding fully convolutional CNN architecture was composed entirely of 3 脳 3 convolutions, a total of four strided convolutions instead of pooling layers, and symmetric residual connections. L2 regularization and augmentation methods were implemented to prevent overfitting. Cases were separated into training (80%) and test sets (20%). A 5-fold cross validation was performed. Software code was written in Python using the TensorFlow module on a Linux workstation with NVIDIA GTX 1070 Pascal GPU.
Results: The average age of patients between the case and the control groups was not statistically different [case: 57.4years (SD, 10.4) and control: 58.2years (SD, 10.9), p = 0.33]. Breast Density (BD) was significantly higher in the case group [2.39 (SD, 0.7)] than the control group [1.98 (SD, 0.75), p < 0.0001]. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, both CNN pixel-wise mammographic risk model and BD were significant independent predictors of breast cancer risk (p < 0.0001). The CNN risk model showed greater predictive potential [OR = 4.42 (95% CI, 3.4-5.7] compared to BD [OR = 1.67 (95% CI, 1.4-1.9). The CNN risk model achieved an overall accuracy of 72% (95%CI, 69.8-74.4) in predicting patients in the case group.
Conclusion: Novel pixel-wise mammographic breast evaluation using a CNN architecture can stratify breast cancer risk, independent of the BD. Larger dataset will likely improve our model."

Methods: The BC risk at 5 and 10 years was estimated with the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) and Benign Breast Disease to Breast Cancer (BBD-BC) models for women diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) at the Mayo Clinic from 1997 to 2001. Women with BBD were eligible for the BBD-BC model, but the BCSC model also required a screening mammogram. Calibration and discrimination were assessed.
Results: Fifty-six cases of BC were diagnosed among the 2142 women with BBD (median age, 50 years) within 5 years (118 were diagnosed within 10 years).

This study examined the performance of 2 BC risk models that integrate clinical and histologic findings in this population.
Methods: The BC risk at 5 and 10 years was estimated with the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) and Benign Breast Disease to Breast Cancer (BBD-BC) models for women diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) at the Mayo Clinic from 1997 to 2001. Women with BBD were eligible for the BBD-BC model, but the BCSC model also required a screening mammogram. Calibration and discrimination were assessed.
Results: Fifty-six cases of BC were diagnosed among the 2142 women with BBD (median age, 50 years) within 5 years (118 were diagnosed within 10 years). The BBD-BC model had slightly better calibration at 5 years (0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-1.21) versus 10 years (0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-1.00) but similar discrimination in the 2 time periods: 0.68 (95% CI, 0.60-0.75) and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.60-0.71), respectively. In contrast, among the 1089 women with screening mammograms (98 cases of BC within 10 years), the BCSC model had better calibration (0.94; 95% CI, 0.85-1.43) and discrimination (0.63; 95% CI, 0.56-0.71) at 10 years versus 5 years (calibration, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.94-2.25; discrimination, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.46-0.71) where discrimination was not different from chance.
Conclusions: The BCSC and BBD-BC models were validated in the Mayo BBD cohort, although their performance differed by 5-year risk versus 10-year risk. Further enhancement of these models is needed to provide accurate BC risk estimates for women with BBD."

Methods: In two academic centres in the Netherlands, we established a list of patients aged 鈮40 years who received a chest CT scan between 2004 and 2012, resulting in 16 850 and 23 454 eligible subjects. Subsequent diagnosis of lung cancer until the end of 2014 was established through linking with the National Cancer Registry. A nested case-control study was performed (ratio 1:3). Two observers used semiautomated software to annotate the nodules. The Brock model was separately validated on each data set using ROC analysis and compared with a solely size-based model.
Results: After the annotation process the final analysis included 177 malignant and 695 benign nodules for centre A, and 264 malignant and 710 benign nodules for centre B. The full Brock model resulted in areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.90 and 0.91, while the size-only model yielded significantly lower AUCs of 0.88 and 0.87, respectively (p<0.001). At 10% malignancy risk, the threshold suggested by the British Thoracic Society, sensitivity of the full model was 75% and 81%, specificity was 85% and 84%, positive predictive values were 14% and 10% at negative predictive value (NPV) of 99%. The optimal threshold was 6% for centre A and 8% for centre B, with NPVs >99%.

We aimed to develop and validate a model to determine risk of PC in patients with NOD.
Methods: We retrospectively collected data from 4 independent and nonoverlapping cohorts of patients (N = 1,561) with NOD (based on glycemic status; data collected at date of diagnosis and 12 months previously) in the Rochester Epidemiology Project from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2015 to create our model. The model weighed scores for 3 factors identified in the discovery cohort to be most strongly associated with PC (64 patients with PC and 192 with type 2 diabetes): change in weight, change in blood glucose, and age at onset of diabetes. We called our model Enriching New-Onset Diabetes for Pancreatic Cancer (ENDPAC). We validated the locked-down model and cutoff score in an independent population-based cohort of 1,096 patients with diabetes; of these, 9 patients (82%) had PC within 3 years of meeting the criteria for NOD.
Results: In the discovery cohort, the END-PAC model identified patients who developed PC within 3 years of diabetes onset (area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.87); a score of at least 3 identified patients who developed PC with 80% sensitivity and specificity. In the validation cohort, a score of at least 3 identified 7 of 9 patients with PC (78%) with 85% specificity; the prevalence of PC in patients with a score of at least 3 (3.6%) was 4.4-fold greater than in patients with NOD. A high END-PAC score in patients who did not have PC (false positives) was often due to such factors as recent steroid use or different malignancy. An ENDPAC score no higher than 0 (in 49% of patients) meant that patients had an extremely low risk for PC. An END-PAC score of at least 3 identified 75% of patients in the discovery cohort more than 6 months before a diagnosis of PC.
Conclusions: Based on change in weight, change in blood glucose, and age at onset of diabetes, we developed and validated a model to determine risk of PC in patients with NOD based on glycemic status (END-PAC model). An independent prospective study is needed to further validate this model, which could contribute to early detection of PC."

Methods: The dataset includes digital mammograms acquired from 392 women with two sequential full-field digital mammography examinations. All the first (""prior"") sets of mammograms were interpreted as negative during the original reading. In the sequential (""current"") screening, 202 were proved positive and 190 remained negative/benign. For each pair of the ""prior"" ipsilateral mammograms, we adaptively fused the image features computed from two views. Using four different types of image features, we built four elastic net support vector machine (EnSVM) based classifiers. Then, the initial prediction scores form the 4 EnSVMs were combined to build a final artificial neural network (ANN) classifier that produces the final risk prediction score. The performance of the new scheme was evaluated by using a 10-fold cross-validation method and an assessment index of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
Results: A total number of 466 features were initially extracted from each pair of ipsilateral mammograms. Among them, 51 were selected to build the EnSVM based prediction scheme. The AUC = 0.737 卤 0.052 was yielded using the new scheme. Applying an optimal operating threshold, the prediction sensitivity was 60.4% (122 of 202) and the specificity was 79.0% (150 of 190).

We developed models to determine risk of CRC, based on lifestyle and environmental factors and genetic variants, and to identify an optimal age to begin screening.
Methods: We collected data from 9748 CRC cases and 10,590 controls in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium and the Colorectal Transdisciplinary study, from 1992 through 2005. Half of the participants were used to develop the risk determination model and the other half were used to evaluate the discriminatory accuracy (validation set). Models of CRC risk were created based on family history, 19 lifestyle and environmental factors (E-score), and 63 CRC-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified in genome-wide association studies (G-score). We evaluated the discriminatory accuracy of the models by calculating area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values, adjusting for study, age, and endoscopy history for the validation set. We used the models to project the 10-year absolute risk of CRC for a given risk profile and recommend ages to begin screening in comparison to CRC risk for an average individual at 50 years of age, using external population incidence rates for non-Hispanic whites from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program registry.
Results: In our models, E-score and G-score each determined risk of CRC with greater accuracy than family history. A model that combined both scores and family history estimated CRC risk with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.63 (95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.64) for men and 0.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.61-0.63) for women; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values based on only family history ranged from 0.53 to 0.54 and those based only E-score or G-score ranged from 0.59 to 0.60. Although screening is recommended to begin at age 50 years for individuals with no family history of CRC, starting ages calculated based on combined E-score and G-score differed by 12 years for men and 14 for women, for individuals with the highest vs the lowest 10% of risk.
Conclusions: We used data from 2 large international consortia to develop CRC risk calculation models that included genetic and environmental factors along with family history. These determine risk of CRC and starting ages for screening with greater accuracy than the family history only model, which is based on the current screening guideline.

Objective: To determine whether incorporation of the novel urinary markers prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) and TMPRSS2:ERG (T2:ERG) into the PCPTRC improves its discrimination, accuracy, and clinical net benefit.
Design, setting, and participants: Since PCA3 and T2:ERG were not measured as part of the PCPTRC, a Bayesian modeling approach was used to combine data where the markers were measured in a Michigan cohort with the PCPTRC as prior probabilities to form an updated PCPTRC. This update was compared to the existing PCPTRC on an independent Early Detection Research Network cohort in terms of discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis.
Results and limitations: Among the 1225 Michigan biopsies, 57.7%, 24.0%, and 18.3% were negative, with low- and high-grade (Gleason grade鈮7) prostate cancer, respectively. Evaluated on the Early Detection Research Network validation set comprising 854 biopsies, areas under the curve (95% confidence interval) for predicting high-grade cancer in the 854 biopsies comprising the validation set were 70.0% (66.0-74.0%), 76.4% (72.8-80.0%), and 77.1% (73.6-80.6%) for the PCPTRC alone, with PCA3 added, and PCA3 and T2:ERG added, respectively. Net benefit was improved for the updated PCPTRC, while calibration was not. Limitations are that the updated PCPTRC is based on two different cohorts, the PCPT and Michigan, and that 20% of the validation set came from the Michigan center. More validation is required; hence, the updated risk tool is posted online.
Conclusions: Incorporation of PCA3 into the PCPTRC improved validation on an independent cohort, whereas T2:ERG offered negligible utility in addition to PCA3.
Patient summary: After passing external validation, prostate cancer antigen 3 has been added to the online Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator for use by patients in deciding whether to proceed to biopsy. TMPRSS2:ERG did not improve prediction on the external validation set, but is included for further validation."

Patients and methods: A total of 691 patients with pulmonary lesions were recruited from three centers in China. The cut-off value for each tumor marker was confirmed by minimum P value method with 1000 bootstrap replications. The nomogram was based on the predictive factors identified by univariate and multivariate analysis. The predictive performance of the nomogram was measured by concordance index and calibrated with 1000 bootstrap samples to decrease the overfit bias. We also evaluated the net benefit of the nomogram via decision curve analysis. Finally, the nomogram was validated externally using a separate cohort of 305 patients enrolled from two additional institutions.
Results: The cut-off for CEA, SCC, CYFRA21-1, pro-GRP, and HE4 was 4.8 ng/mL, 1.66 ng/mL, 1.83 ng/mL, 56.55 pg/mL, and 63.24Lpmol/L, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression model (LRM) identified tumor size, CEA, SCC, CYFRA21-1, pro-GRP, and HE4 as independent risk factors for lung cancer. The nomogram based on LRM coefficients showed concordance index of 0.901 (95% CI: 0.842-0.960; P < 0.001) for lung cancer in the training set and 0.713 (95% CI: 0.599-0.827; P < 0.001) in the validation set.

Materials and methods: With Institutional Review Board approval and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance, we retrospectively analyzed ""For Processing"" contralateral digital mammograms (GE Healthcare 2000D/DS) from 106 women with unilateral invasive breast cancer and 318 age-matched controls. We coupled established texture features (histogram, co-occurrence, run-length, structural), extracted using a previously validated lattice-based strategy, with a multichannel CNN into a hybrid framework in which a multitude of texture feature maps are reduced to meta-features predicting the case or control status. We evaluated the framework in a randomized split-sample setting, using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) to assess case-control discriminatory capacity. We also compared the framework to CNNs directly fed with mammographic images, as well as to conventional texture analysis, where texture feature maps are summarized via simple statistical measures that are then used as inputs to a logistic regression model.
Results: Strong case-control discriminatory capacity was demonstrated on the basis of the meta-features generated by the hybrid framework (AUC = 0.90), outperforming both CNNs applied directly to raw image data (AUC = 0.63, P <.05) and conventional texture analysis (AUC = 0.79, P <.05).
Conclusions: Our results suggest that informative interactions between patterns exist in texture feature maps derived from mammographic images, which can be extracted and summarized via a multichannel CNN architecture toward leveraging the associations of textural measurements to breast cancer risk."

We developed the next generation of prostate cancer risk calculator that incorporates life expectancy in order to better evaluate prostate cancer risk in context to a patient's age and comorbidity.
Methods: We combined two cohorts to develop the new risk calculator. The first was 5638 subjects who all underwent a prostate biopsy for prostate cancer detection. The second was 979 men diagnosed with prostate cancer with long-term survival data. Two regression models were used to create multivariable nomograms and an online prostate cancer risk calculator was developed.
Results: Of the 5638 patients who underwent a prostate biopsy, 629 (11%) were diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason Score 7[4+3] or more). Of the 979 patients who underwent treatment for prostate cancer, the 10-year overall survival (OS) was 49.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 46.6-52.9). The first multivariable nomogram for cancer risk had a concordance index of 0.74 (95% CI 0.72, 0.76), and the second nomogram to predict survival had a concordance index of 0.71 (95% CI 0.69-0.72). The next-generation prostate cancer risk calculator was developed online and is available at: http://riskcalc.org/ProstateCA_Screen_Tool.
Conclusions: We have developed the next-generation prostate cancer risk calculator that incorporates a patient's life expectancy based on age and comorbidity. This approach will better evaluate prostate cancer risk. Future studies examining other populations will be needed for validation."

Materials and methods: Approval from the institutional review board and informed consent were acquired for this study. The MR images of 104 patients with pathologically proven breast cancer (104 lesions) were prospectively analyzed. All of included patients were Chinese woman. The DCE-MRI morphologic findings, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, quantitative DCE-MRI parameters, and pathological biomarkers between the two subtypes of breast cancer were compared. The quantitative DCE-MRI parameters and ADC values were added to the morphologic features in multivariate models to evaluate diagnostic performance in predicting low-risk breast cancer. The values were further subjected to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
Results: Low-risk tumors showed significantly lower Ktrans and Kepvalues (t = 2.065, P = 0.043 and t = 3.548, P = 0.001, respectively) and higher ADC value (t = 4.713, P = 0.000) than non-low-risk breast cancers. Our results revealed no significant differences in clinic data and conventional imaging findings between the two breast cancer subtypes. Adding the quantitative DCE-MRI parameters and ADC values to conventional MRI improved the diagnostic performance of MRI: The area under the ROC improved from 0.63 to 0.91. Low-risk breast cancers showed significantly lower matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 expression (P = 0.000), lower MMP-9 expression (P = 0.001), and lower microvessel density (MVD) values (P = 0.008) compared with non-low-risk breast cancers. Ktrans and Kep values were positively correlated with pathological biomarkers. The ADC value showed a significant inverse correlation with pathological biomarkers.
Conclusions: The prediction parameter using Ktrans, Kep, and ADC obtained on DCE-MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging could facilitate the identification of low-risk breast cancers. Decreased biological factors, including MVD, vascular endothelial growth factor, MMP-2, and MMP-9, may explain the possible pathological basis."

We constructed a risk prediction model using a population of 59 161 individuals from the Japan Public Health Center (JPHC) Study Cohort II. A parametric survival model was used to assess the impact of age, gender, and smoking-related factors (cumulative smoking intensity measured in pack-years, age at initiation, and time since cessation). Ten-year cumulative probability of lung cancer occurrence estimates were calculated with consideration of the competing risk of death from other causes. Finally, the model was externally validated using 47 501 individuals from JPHC Study Cohort I. A total of 1210 cases of lung cancer occurred during 986 408 person-years of follow-up. We found a dose-dependent effect of tobacco consumption with hazard ratios for current smokers ranging from 3.78 (2.00-7.16) for cumulative consumption 鈮15 pack-years to 15.80 (9.67-25.79) for >75 pack-years. Risk decreased with time since cessation. Ten-year cumulative probability of lung cancer occurrence estimates ranged from 0.04% to 11.14% in men and 0.07% to 6.55% in women. The model showed good predictive performance regarding discrimination (cross-validated c-index = 0.793) and calibration (cross-validated 蠂2 = 6.60; P-value = .58). The model still showed good discrimination in the external validation population (c-index = 0.772). In conclusion, we developed a prediction model to estimate the probability of developing lung cancer based on age, gender, and tobacco consumption. This model appears useful in encouraging high-risk individuals to quit smoking and undergo increased surveillance."

Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were constructed from the published odds ratios (ORs) of four sets of susceptibility loci for breast cancer. Discrimination capacity was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
Results: Flip-flop phenomenon was observed among 30~40% of variants across studies. Using the 34 variants with consistent directionality among previous studies, we constructed a PRS with AUC of 0.531 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.512-0.550), which is similar to the PRS using 93 variants and ORs from European ancestry populations (AUC = 0.525, 95% CI: 0.506-0.544). Additionally, we found the 34-variant PRS has good discriminative accuracy in women with family history of breast cancer (AUC = 0.586, 95% CI: 0.532-0.640).
Conclusions: We found that PRS based on variants identified from prior GWASs conducted in women of European and Asian ancestries did not provide a comparable degree of risk stratification for women of African ancestry. Further large-scale fine-mapping studies in African ancestry populations are desirable to discover population-specific genetic risk variants."

Methods: This retrospective multicentre cohort study included 1,246 patients who received entecavir and regular HCC surveillance in three tertiary referral centres in South Korea. Liver volumes were measured on portal venous phase CT images. A nomogram was developed based on Cox independent predictors and externally validated. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for comparison with previous prediction models.
Results: Patients who received dynamic CT studies during surveillance had significantly higher risk for HCC compared to patients without CT studies (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.1; p < 0.001). Expected/measured liver volume ratio was an independent predictor of HCC (HR = 4.2; p = 0.002) in addition to age, sex and cirrhosis. The nomogram based on the four predictors discriminated risks for HCC (HR = 4.1 and 6.0 in derivation and validation cohort, respectively, for volume score > 150; p < 0.001). Time-dependent ROC analysis confirmed better performance of the volume score compared to HCC prediction models with conventional predictors (integrated area under curve = 0.758 vs. 0.661-0.712; p < 0.05).
Conclusions: CT-measured liver volume is an independent predictor of future HCC, and nomogram-based liver volume score may stratify the risks of HCC in CHB patients who showed negative CT findings for HCC during surveillance."

The biological characteristics of PC in East Asians including Koreans and Japanese are different from those in the Western populations. Potential lifestyle risk factors for PC were evaluated with the aim of developing a risk prediction model.
Materials and methods: A total of 1,179,172 Korean men who were cancer free from 1996 to 1997, had taken a physical examination, and completed a lifestyle questionnaire, were enrolled in our study to predict their risk for PC for the next eight years, using the Cox proportional hazards model. The model's performance was evaluated using the C-statistic and Hosmer鈥扡emeshow type chi-square statistics.
Results: The risk prediction model studied age, height, body mass index, glucose levels, family history of cancer, the frequency of meat consumption, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and physical activity, which were all significant risk factors in a univariate analysis. The model performed very well (C statistic, 0.887; 95% confidence interval, 0.879 to 0.895) and estimated an elevated PC risk in patients who did not consume alcohol or smoke, compared to heavy alcohol consumers (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78) and current smokers (HR, 0.73) (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: This model can be used for identifying Korean and other East Asian men who are at a high risk for developing PC, as well as for cancer screening and developing preventive health strategies."

Methods: We enrolled 1325 NA-na茂ve chronic hepatitis B patients with entecavir monotherapy for >12 months, with 883 and 442 patients randomly assigned to the development and validation groups, respectively, in the risk model.
Results: The cumulative probabilities of HCC were 2.4%, 4.1%, and 9.9% after 2, 3, and 5 years of treatment, respectively. In the development group, age, platelet counts, and alpha-fetoprotein levels after 12 months of treatment were the independent predictors of HCC.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a risk assessment tool for discerning future gastric cancer risk in Japanese.
Methods: A total of 2444 subjects aged 40 years or over were followed up for 14 years from 1988 (derivation cohort), and 3204 subjects of the same age group were followed up for 5 years from 2002 (validation cohort). The weighting (risk score) of each risk factor for predicting future gastric cancer in the risk assessment tool was determined based on the coefficients of a Cox proportional hazards model in the derivation cohort. The goodness of fit of the established risk assessment tool was assessed using the c-statistic and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test in the validation cohort.
Results: During the follow-up, gastric cancer developed in 90 subjects in the derivation cohort and 35 subjects in the validation cohort. In the derivation cohort, the risk prediction model for gastric cancer was established using significant risk factors: age, sex, the combination of Helicobacter pylori antibody and pepsinogen status, hemoglobin A1c level, and smoking status. The incidence of gastric cancer increased significantly as the sum of risk scores increased (P trend < 0.001).

Materials and methods: The dataset included 168 negative mammography screening cases. In developing and testing our new risk model, we first converted the original grayscale value (GV)-based mammographic images into optical density (OD)-based images. For each case, our computer-aided scheme then computed two types of image features representing bilateral asymmetry and the maximum of the image features computed from GV and OD images, respectively. A two-stage classification scheme consisting of three ANNs was developed. The first stage included two ANNs trained using features computed separately from GV and OD images of 138 cases. The second stage included another ANN to fuse the prediction scores produced by two ANNs in the first stage. The risk prediction performance was tested using the rest 30 cases.
Results: With the two-stage classification scheme, the computed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.816 卤 0.071, which was significantly higher than the AUC values of 0.669 卤 0.099 and 0.646 卤 0.099 achieved using two ANNs trained using GV features and OD features, respectively (P < .05).

Aim: Develop a scoring system to forecast HCC risk among patients with chronic hepatitis C.
Methods: Using data from the Chronic Hepatitis Cohort Study collected during 2005-2014, we derived HCC risk scores for males and females using an extended Cox model with aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) as a time-dependent variables and mean Kaplan-Meier survival functions from patient data at two study sites, and used data collected at two separate sites for external validation. For model calibration, we used the Greenwood-Nam-D'Agostino goodness-of-fit statistic to examine differences between predicted and observed risk.
Results: Of 12,469 patients (1628 with a history of sustained viral response [SVR]), 504 developed HCC; median follow-up was 6 years. Final predictors in the model included age, alcohol abuse, interferon-based treatment response, and APRI. Point values, ranging from -3 to 14 (males) and -3 to 12 (females), were established using hazard ratios of the predictors aligned with 1-, 3-, and 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities of HCC. Discriminatory capacity was high (c-index 0.82 males and 0.84 females) and external calibration demonstrated no differences between predicted and observed HCC risk for 1-, 3-, and 5-year forecasts among males (all p values >0.97) and for 3- and 5-year risk among females (all p values >0.87).

Results: Of the 241 men included in the study, 41% (n = 98) had prostate cancer (81 were clinically significant, i.e. Gleason 鈮3 + 4). There was substantial agreement in the digital rectal examination (abnormal/normal; 魏 = 0.78; P < 0.001) and volume estimation (魏 = 0.79; P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed good discrimination (0.75-0.78) and were comparable for both urologists. In the high-risk cohort, at a probability threshold of 25%, the risk calculator reduced the prostate biopsy rate by 9%, without missing cancers.
Conclusions: Slight differences in digital rectal examination findings seem to have very limited impact on the performance of the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator. Therefore, this can be considered a useful prostate biopsy outcome prediction tool."

Purpose: To develop a prebiopsy multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)-based risk score (RS) and a statistical equation for predicting the risk of PCa in biopsy-naive men with serum PSA between 4-10 ng/mL that may help reduce unnecessary biopsies.
Study type: Prospective cross-sectional study.
Subjects: In all, 137 consecutive men with PSA between 4-10 ng/mL underwent prebiopsy mpMRI (diffusion-weighted [DW]-MRI and MR spectroscopic imaging [MRSI]) during 2009-2015 were recruited for this study.
Field strength/sequence: 1.5T (Avanto, Siemens Health Care, Erlangen, Germany); T1 -weighted, T2 -weighted, DW-MRI, and MRSI sequences were used.
Assessment: All eligible patients underwent mpMRI-directed, cognitive-fusion transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsies.
Statistical tests: An equation model and an RS were developed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and a multivariable logistic regression approach. A 10-fold crossvalidation and simulation analyses were performed to assess diagnostic performance of various combinations of mpMRI parameters.
Results: Of 137 patients, 32 were diagnosed with PCa on biopsy.

We explored whether the use of risk prediction models can dynamically predict HCC development at different time points in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients.
Methods: Between 2006 and 2014, 1397 CHB patients were recruited. All patients underwent serial transient elastography at intervals of >6 months.
Results: The median age of this study population (931 males and 466 females) was 49.0 years. The median CU-HCC, REACH-B, LSM-HCC and mREACH-B score at enrolment were 4.0, 9.0, 10.0 and 8.0 respectively. During the follow-up period (median, 68.0 months), 87 (6.2%) patients developed HCC. All risk prediction models were successful in predicting HCC development at both the first liver stiffness (LS) measurement (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.067-1.467 in the subgroup without antiviral therapy [AVT] and 1.096-1.458 in the subgroup with AVT) and second LS measurement (HR = 1.125-1.448 in the subgroup without AVT and 1.087-1.249 in the subgroup with AVT). In contrast, neither the absolute nor percentage change in the scores from the risk prediction models predicted HCC development (all P > .05). The mREACH-B score performed similarly or significantly better than did the other scores (AUROCs at 5 years, 0.694-0.862 vs 0.537-0.875).
Conclusions: Dynamic prediction of HCC development at different time points was achieved using four risk prediction models, but not using the changes in the absolute and percentage values between two time points. The mREACH-B score was the most appropriate prediction model of HCC development among four prediction models."

We examined the independent contribution of dense breast volume and BI-RADS breast density to predict invasive breast cancer and whether dense breast volume combined with Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) risk model factors (age, race/ethnicity, family history of breast cancer, history of breast biopsy, and BI-RADS breast density) improves identifying women with dense breasts at high breast cancer risk.
Methods: We conducted a case-control study of 1720 women with invasive cancer and 3686 control subjects. We calculated ORs and 95% CIs for the effect of BI-RADS breast density and Volpara鈩 automated dense breast volume on invasive cancer risk, adjusting for other BCSC risk model factors plus body mass index (BMI), and we compared C-statistics between models. We calculated BCSC 5-year breast cancer risk, incorporating the adjusted ORs associated with dense breast volume.
Results: Compared with women with BI-RADS scattered fibroglandular densities and second-quartile dense breast volume, women with BI-RADS extremely dense breasts and third- or fourth-quartile dense breast volume (75% of women with extremely dense breasts) had high breast cancer risk (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.84-4.47, and OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.87-3.52, respectively), whereas women with extremely dense breasts and first- or second-quartile dense breast volume were not at significantly increased breast cancer risk (OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.75-3.09, and OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.82-2.73, respectively). Adding continuous dense breast volume to a model with BCSC risk model factors and BMI increased discriminatory accuracy compared with a model with only BCSC risk model factors (C-statistic 0.639, 95% CI 0.623-0.654, vs. C-statistic 0.614, 95% CI 0.598-0.630, respectively; P < 0.001). Women with dense breasts and fourth-quartile dense breast volume had a BCSC 5-year risk of 2.5%, whereas women with dense breasts and first-quartile dense breast volume had a 5-year risk 鈮 1.8%.

Objective: To report the diagnostic accuracy of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) risk calculator (RC)3 and RC4 in a contemporary Dutch clinical cohort.
Design, setting, and participants: We retrospectively identified all men who underwent prostate biopsy (PBx) in the Jeroen Bosch Hospital, The Netherlands, between 2007 and 2016. Patients were included if they met ERSPC RC requirements of age (50-80 yr), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (0.4-50 ng/ml), and prostate volume (10-150ml). The probability of a positive biopsy for prostate cancer (PCa) and significant PCa (Gleason score 鈮7 and/or higher than T2b) were calculated and compared with PBx pathology results.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Evaluation was performed by calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness using calibration plots, area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), and decision curve analyses (DCAs), respectively.
Results and limitations: A total of 2270 PBx sessions were eligible for final analysis. Discriminative ability of RC3 (AUC) was 0.78 and 0.90 for any PCa and significant PCa, respectively. For RC4 the calculated AUCs were 0.62 (any PCa) and 0.76 (significant PCa). The calibration plots of RC3 showed good results for both any PCa risk and significant PCa risk. In the repeat PBx group, RC4 tended to underestimate outcomes for PCa and showed moderate calibration for significant PCa. DCA showed an overall net benefit compared with PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE) alone. Limitations of this study are its retrospective single-institution design, retrospectively assessed DRE outcomes, no time restrictions between the first and repeat biopsy sessions, and no anterior sampling in the repeat PBx protocol.

Methods: Using data from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and NHSII, we added adolescent somatotype (9 unit scale), vegetable intake (servings/day), breastfeeding (months), physical activity (MET-h/week), and predicted percent MD to the Rosner-Colditz model to determine whether these variables improved model discrimination. We evaluated all invasive as well as ER+/PR+, ER+/PR-, and ER-/PR- breast cancer.
Results: In the NHS/NHSII, we accrued over 5200 cases of invasive breast cancer over more than 20 years of follow-up with complete data on the risk factors. Adolescent somatotype and predicted percent MD significantly improved the original Rosner-Colditz model for all invasive breast cancer (change in age-adjusted AUC = 0.020, p < 0.001). The relative risk (RR) of invasive breast cancer for a 4-unit increase in adolescent somatotype was 0.62 (95% CI 0.56, 0.70), whereas the RR for a 20-unit increase in predicted percent MD was 1.32 (95% CI 1.28, 1.36). Adolescent somatotype and predicted percent MD also significantly improved the ER+/PR+model (change in age-adjusted AUC = 0.020, p < 0.001) as well as the ER+/PR- model (change in age-adjusted AUC = 0.012, p = 0.007). Adolescent somatotype, predicted percent MD, breastfeeding, and vegetable intake improved the ER-/PR- model (change in AUC = 0.031, p < 0.0001). The RR of ER-/PR- disease for 5 vegetable servings/day increase was 0.83 (95% CI 0.70, 0.99), while the RR for every 12 months of breastfeeding was 0.88 (95% CI 0.77, 1.01).

Methods: This was a 22-year (1986-2007) retrospective cohort analysis of data collected prospectively from patients who attended colorectal surgical outpatient clinics in Portsmouth. The data set was split randomly into two groups of patients to generate and validate a predictive model. Multivariable logistic regression was used to create and validate a system to predict outcome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow test were used to evaluate the model's predictive capability. The likelihood of bowel cancer was expressed as the odds ratio (OR).
Results: Data from 29 005 patients were analysed. Discrimination of the model for bowel cancer was high in the development (C-statistic 0路87, 95 per cent c.i. 0路85 to 0路88) and validation (C-statistic 0路86, 0路84 to 0路87) groups.

An accurate assessment of individual's breast cancer risk is very important for prevention of the disease and for the health care providers to make decision on taking chemoprevention for high-risk women in clinical practice in Qatar.
Aim: To assess the breast cancer risk among Arab women population in Qatar using the Gail model and provide a global comparison of risk assessment.
Subjects and methods: In this cross-sectional study of 1488 women (aged 35 years and older), we used the Gail Risk Assessment Tool to assess the risk of developing breast cancer. Sociodemographic features such as age, lifestyle habits, body mass index, breast-feeding duration, consanguinity among parents, and family history of breast cancer were considered as possible risks.
Results: The mean age of the study population was 47.8 卤 10.8 years. Qatari women and Arab women constituted 64.7% and 35.3% of the study population, respectively. The mean 5-year and lifetime breast cancer risks were 1.12 卤 0.52 and 10.57 卤 3.1, respectively. Consanguineous marriage among parents was seen in 30.6% of participants. We found a relationship between the 5-year and lifetime risks of breast cancer and variables such as age, age at menarche, gravidity, parity, body mass index, family history of cancer, menopause age, occupation, and level of education. The linear regression analysis identified the predictors for breast cancer in women such as age, age at menarche, age of first birth, family history and age of menopausal were considered the strong predictors and significant contributing risk factors for breast cancer after adjusting for ethnicity, parity and other variables.

We developed a re-fitted version of this model, based on more than twice as many cases now including women up to age 85, and further extended it to a model that distinguished risk factor prediction of tumors with different estrogen/progesterone receptor status.
Methods: We compared the calibration and discriminatory ability of the original, the re-fitted, and the type-specific models. Evaluation used data from the Nurses' Health Study during the period 1980-2008, when 4384 incident invasive breast cancers occurred over 1.5 million person-years. Model development used two-thirds of study subjects and validation used one-third.
Results: Predicted risks in the validation sample from the original and re-fitted models were highly correlated (蟻 = 0.93), but several parameters, notably those related to use of menopausal hormone therapy and age, had different estimates. The re-fitted model was well-calibrated and had an overall C-statistic of 0.65. The extended, type-specific model identified several risk factors with varying associations with occurrence of tumors of different receptor status. However, this extended model relative to the prediction of any breast cancer did not meaningfully reclassify women who developed breast cancer to higher risk categories, nor women remaining cancer free to lower risk categories.
Conclusions: The re-fitted Rosner-Colditz model has applicability to risk prediction in women up to age 85, and its discrimination is not improved by consideration of varying associations across tumor subtypes."

We have developed an oral cancer risk index using DNA index value to quantitatively assess cancer risk in patients with oral leukoplakia, but with limited success. In order to improve the performance of the risk index, we collected exfoliative cytology, histopathology, and clinical follow-up data from two independent cohorts of normal, leukoplakia and cancer subjects (training set and validation set). Peaks were defined on the basis of first derivatives with positives, and modern machine learning techniques were utilized to build statistical prediction models on the reconstructed data. Random forest was found to be the best model with high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (99.2%). Using the Peaks-Random Forest model, we constructed an index (OCRI2) as a quantitative measurement of cancer risk. Among 11 leukoplakia patients with an OCRI2 over 0.5, 4 (36.4%) developed cancer during follow-up (23 卤 20 months), whereas 3 (5.3%) of 57 leukoplakia patients with an OCRI2 less than 0.5 developed cancer (32 卤 31 months). OCRI2 is better than other methods in predicting oral squamous cell carcinoma during follow-up.

Methods: We investigated 2,061 Korean treatment-na茂ve patients with CHB treated with entecavir as an initial therapy. A risk score model for HCC development was developed based on multivariable Cox regression model in a single center (n=990) and was validated using the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) in three other centers (n=1,071). The difference of HCC development among risk groups (low, intermediate, and high) categorized by risk score was also investigated.
Results: The cumulative incidence rates of HCC at 5 years were 11.2% and 8.9% in the testing and validation cohorts, respectively. HCC-Risk Estimating Score in CHB patients Under Entecavir (HCC-RESCUE) is formulated as (age+15脳gender [female=0 / male=1]+23脳cirrhosis [absence=0 / presence=1]). The AUROCs at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years were 0.82, 0.81, and 0.81, respectively, in the validation cohort.

Objective: The impetus of the study was to design, develop, and assess a smartphone app for prostate cancer screening, based on the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator (RPCRC).
Methods: The results of the Rotterdam arm of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) study were used to elaborate several algorithms that allowed the risk of prostate cancer to be estimated. A step-by-step workflow was established to ensure that depending on the available clinical information the most complete risk model of the RPCRC was used. The user interface was designed and then the app was developed as a native app for iOS. The usability of the app was assessed using the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) developed by IBM, in a group of 92 participants comprising urologists, general practitioners, and medical students.
Results: A total of 11 questions were built into the app, and, depending on the answers, one of the different algorithms of the RPCRC could be used to predict the risk of prostate cancer and of clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason score 鈮7 and clinical stage >T2b). The system usefulness, information quality, and interface quality scores were high-92% (27.7/30), 87% (26.2/30), and 89% (13.4/15), respectively. No usability problems were identified.

Decision making based on European Randomised Study of Screening for PC (ERSPC) risk-calculator (RC) parameters may overcome prostate-specific antigen (PSA) limitations.
Objective: We added pre-biopsy mpMRI to ERSPC-RC parameters and developed risk models (RMs) to predict individual sPC risk for biopsy-na茂ve men and men after previous biopsy.
Design, setting, and participants: We retrospectively analyzed clinical parameters of 1159 men who underwent mpMRI prior to MRI/transrectal ultrasound fusion biopsy between 2012 and 2015.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Multivariate regression analyses were used to determine significant sPC predictors for RM development. The prediction performance was compared with ERSPC-RCs, RCs refitted on our cohort, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v1.0, and ERSPC-RC plus PI-RADSv1.0 using receiver-operating characteristics (ROCs). Discrimination and calibration of the RM, as well as net decision and reduction curve analyses were evaluated based on resampling methods.
Results and limitations: PSA, prostate volume, digital-rectal examination, and PI-RADS were significant sPC predictors and included in the RMs together with age. The ROC area under the curve of the RM for biopsy-na茂ve men was comparable with ERSPC-RC3 plus PI-RADSv1.0 (0.83 vs 0.84) but larger compared with ERSPC-RC3 (0.81), refitted RC3 (0.80), and PI-RADS (0.76). For postbiopsy men, the novel RM's discrimination (0.81) was higher, compared with PI-RADS (0.78), ERSPC-RC4 (0.66), refitted RC4 (0.76), and ERSPC-RC4 plus PI-RADSv1.0 (0.78). Both RM benefits exceeded those of ERSPC-RCs and PI-RADS in the decision regarding which patient to receive biopsy and enabled the highest reduction rate of unnecessary biopsies. Limitations include a monocentric design and a lack of PI-RADSv2.0.
Conclusions: The novel RMs, incorporating clinical parameters and PI-RADS, performed significantly better compared with RMs without PI-RADS and provided measurable benefit in making the decision to biopsy men at a suspicion of PC. For biopsy-na茂ve patients, both our RM and ERSPC-RC3 plus PI-RADSv1.0 exceeded the prediction performance compared with clinical parameters alone.
Patient summary: Combined risk models including clinical and imaging parameters predict clinically relevant prostate cancer significantly better than clinical risk calculators and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging alone. The risk models demonstrate a benefit in making a decision about which patient needs a biopsy and concurrently help avoid unnecessary biopsies."

This study aimed to use women's complete cervical screening histories to identify diagnostic patterns that may indicate an increased risk of developing cervical cancer. A nationwide case-control study was performed where cervical cancer screening data from 125,476 women with a maximum follow-up of 10 years were evaluated for patterns of SNOMED diagnoses. The cancer development risk was estimated for a number of different screening history patterns and expressed as Odds Ratios (OR), with a history of 4 benign cervical tests as reference, using logistic regression. The overall performance of the model was moderate (64% accuracy, 71% area under curve) with 61-62% of the study population showing no specific patterns associated with risk. However, predictions for high-risk groups as defined by screening history patterns were highly discriminatory with ORs ranging from 8 to 36. The model for computing risk performed consistently across different screening history lengths, and several patterns predicted cancer outcomes. The results show the presence of risk-increasing and risk-decreasing factors in the screening history. Thus it is feasible to identify subgroups based on their complete screening histories. Several high-risk subgroups identified might benefit from an increased screening density.

Nine previously established risk models were assessed for their ability to identify those most likely to develop or die from lung cancer. All models considered age and various aspects of smoking exposure (smoking status, smoking duration, cigarettes per day, pack-years smoked, time since smoking cessation) as risk predictors. In addition, some models considered factors such as gender, race, ethnicity, education, body mass index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, personal history of cancer, personal history of pneumonia, and family history of lung cancer.
Methods and findings: Retrospective analyses were performed on 53,452 National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) participants (1,925 lung cancer cases and 884 lung cancer deaths) and 80,672 Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) ever-smoking participants (1,463 lung cancer cases and 915 lung cancer deaths). Six-year lung cancer incidence and mortality risk predictions were assessed for (1) calibration (graphically) by comparing the agreement between the predicted and the observed risks, (2) discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) between individuals with and without lung cancer (death), and (3) clinical usefulness (net benefit in decision curve analysis) by identifying risk thresholds at which applying risk-based eligibility would improve lung cancer screening efficacy.

The models outperformed the NLST eligibility criteria over a substantial range of risk thresholds in decision curve analysis, with a higher sensitivity for all models and a slightly higher specificity for some models. The PLCOm2012, Bach, and Two-Stage Clonal Expansion incidence models had the best overall performance, with AUCs >0.68 in the NLST and >0.77 in the PLCO.

In contrast, the NLST eligibility criteria yielded a sensitivity of 71.4% and a specificity of 62.2%. Limitations of this study include the lack of identification of optimal risk thresholds, as this requires additional information on the long-term benefits (e.g., life-years gained and mortality reduction) and harms (e.g., overdiagnosis) of risk-based screening strategies using these models. In addition, information on some predictor variables included in the risk prediction models was not available.
Conclusions: Selection of individuals for lung cancer screening using individual risk is superior to selection criteria based on age and pack-years alone. The benefits, harms, and feasibility of implementing lung cancer screening policies based on risk prediction models should be assessed and compared with those of current recommendations."

In addition, information on some predictor variables included in the risk prediction models was not available.
Conclusions: Selection of individuals for lung cancer screening using individual risk is superior to selection criteria based on age and pack-years alone. The benefits, harms, and feasibility of implementing lung cancer screening policies based on risk prediction models should be assessed and compared with those of current recommendations."

Methods: We collected findings from 15,073 permanent residents (45-69 years old) of 334 randomly selected villages in Hua County, Henan Province, China who underwent endoscopic screening (with iodine staining) for ESCC from January 2012 through September 2015. The entire esophagus and stomach were examined; biopsies were collected from all focal lesions (or from standard sites in the esophagus if no abnormalities were found) and analyzed histologically. Squamous dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, and ESCC were independently confirmed by 2 pathologists. Before endoscopy, subjects completed a questionnaire on ESCC risk factors. Variables were evaluated with unconditional univariate logistic regression analysis; variables found to be significantly associated with ESCC were then analyzed by multivariate logistic regression modeling. We used the Akaike information criterion to develop our final model structure and the coding form of variables with multiple measures. We developed 2 groups of models, separately defining severe dysplasia and above (SDA) (lesions including severe dysplasia and higher-grade lesions) and moderate dysplasia and above (lesions including moderate dysplasia and higher-grade lesions) as outcome events. Age-stratified and whole-age models were developed; their discriminative ability in the full multivariate model and the simple age model was compared. We performed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the DeLong test to evaluate model performance.
Results: Our age-stratified prediction models identified individuals 60 years of age or younger with SDA with an AUC value of 0.795 (95% confidence interval, 0.736-0.854) and individuals older than 60 years with SDA with an AUC value of 0.681 (95% confidence interval, 0.618-0.743). Factors associated with SDA in individuals 60 years or younger included age closer to 60 years, use of coal or wood as a main source of cooking fuel, body mass index of 22 kg/m2 or less, unexplained epigastric pain, and rapid ingestion of meals. In subjects older than 60 years, SDA associated with age, family history of ESCC, cigarette smoking, body mass index of 22 kg/m2 or less, pesticide exposure, irregular eating habits, intake of high temperature foods, rapid ingestion of meals, and ingestion of leftover food in summer months. Use of our model in screening could have allowed 27% of subjects 60 years or younger and 9% of subjects older than 60 years to avoid endoscopy without missing SDAs. This means that approximately 2500 of endoscopies in total (16.6%) could have been avoided.
Conclusions: We developed a low-cost, easy-to-use model to identify individuals at risk for severe dysplasia or cancer of the esophagus living in a region of China with a high risk of ESCC. This model might be used to select individuals and groups of persons who should undergo endoscopy analysis for esophageal cancer."

Our aim was to develop a valid predictive mathematical model for selecting high-risk groups eligible for mammography examinations (MAMs) and cost-effective strategies for breast cancer screening among Chinese women.
Methods: Between 2009 and 2012, 13,355 eligible women aged 30-65 years were enrolled from the community in Chengdu City. All subjects were administered a valid questionnaire and given MAMs. Using biopsies and 1-year follow up, we compared the accuracy indexes of three predictive models (back-propagation artificial neural network [BP-ANN], logistic regression [LR], and Gail) and four serial screening strategies (BP-ANN鈫扢AM, LR鈫扢AM, Gail鈫扢AM, and MAM alone). We also evaluated the benefits of the four strategies by comparing their incidence-adjusted positive predictive value (PPV). All analyses were conducted with three age-based subgroups: 30-39, 40-49, and 50-65.
Results: The BP-ANN1, in conjunction with additional continuous risk factor variables, was the best predictive model, with the highest sensitivity (SEN, 76.99%) and specificity (SPE, 54.20%). The BP-ANN1鈫扢AM strategy was best for the 40-49 age group, with the highest adjusted PPV (9.80%) and reasonable SEN (81.82%).
Conclusion: We found that the BP-ANN model performed the best and was the most accurate for predicting high risk for breast cancer among Chinese women, and the BP-ANN鈫扢AM screening strategy was most effective among the 40-49 age group. However, mammography alone may be a sufficient screening strategy for women aged 50-65."

The Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) and International Breast Cancer Intervention Study (IBIS) are among these approaches. We compared the performance of these models in discriminating between cases and noncases in the Iranian population.
Patients and methods: We performed a case-control study in Tehran, from November 2015 to April 2016, and enrolled 1633 women aged 24 to 75 years, including 506 cases of breast cancer, 916 population-based controls, and 211 clinic-based controls. We calculated and compared the risk of breast cancer predicted by the IBIS and BOADICEA models and the logistic regression model. For model discrimination, we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
Results: The risk of breast cancer predicted by the IBIS model was higher than the BOADICEA model, but lower than the logistic model. The area under the ROC plots indicated that the logistic regression model showed better discrimination between cases and noncases (71.53%) compared with the IBIS model (49.36%) and BOADICEA model (35.84%).

Patients and methods: Development of the model was based on a prospective cohort including 393 men who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) before biopsy. External validity of the model was then examined retrospectively in 198 men from a separate institution whom underwent mpMRI followed by biopsy for abnormal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level or digital rectal examination (DRE). A model was developed with age, PSA level, DRE, prostate volume, previous biopsy, and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) score, as predictors for significant prostate cancer (Gleason 7 with >5% grade 4, 鈮20% cores positive or 鈮7 mm of cancer in any core). Probability was studied via logistic regression. Discriminatory performance was quantified by concordance statistics and internally validated with bootstrap resampling.
Results: In all, 393 men had complete data and 149 (37.9%) had significant prostate cancer. While the variable model had good accuracy in predicting significant prostate cancer, area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80, the advanced model (incorporating mpMRI) had a significantly higher AUC of 0.88 (P < 0.001).

In this study, we analyzed the breast cancer risk in relation to 13 individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by a GWAS in an Asian population.
Methods: In total, 446 breast cancer patients and 514 healthy controls were recruited for this case-control study. In addition, we developed a polygenic risk score (PRS) including those variants significantly associated with breast cancer risk, and also evaluated the contribution of PRS and clinical risk factors to breast cancer using receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
Results: Logistic regression results showed that nine individual SNPs were significantly associated with breast cancer risk after multiple testing. Among all SNPs, six variants, namely FGFR2 (rs2981582), HCN1 (rs981782), MAP3K1 (rs889312), TOX3 (rs3803662), ZNF365 (rs10822013), and RAD51B (rs3784099), were selected to create PRS model. A dose-response association was observed between breast cancer risk and the PRS. Women in the highest quartile of PRS had a significantly increased risk compared to women in the lowest quartile (odds ratio 2.26; 95% confidence interval 1.51-3.38). The AUC for a model which contained the PRS in addition to clinical risk factors was 66.52%, whereas that for a model which with established risk factors only was 63.38%.
Conclusions: Our data identified a genetic risk predictor of breast cancer in Taiwanese population and suggest that risk models including PRS and clinical risk factors are useful in discriminating women at high risk of breast cancer from those at low risk."

This study aimed to derive a risk-scoring model incorporating laboratory indicators for metabolic risks to predict advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACN) in asymptomatic Korean adults both younger and older than 50 years.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 70 812 consecutive adult recipients of a screening colonoscopy in a single health check-up center in Korea between 2003 and 2012 were enrolled. A risk score model was developed using multiple logistic regression model and internally validated.
Results: Overall prevalence of ACN was 1.4% (956/70 812). A 15-point score model was developed to comprise age, sex, family history of colorectal cancer, smoking, body mass index, serum levels of fasting glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and carcinoembryonic antigen. Based on the score, the validation cohort could be categorized into five risk groups (low, borderline, moderate, high, and very high) with an ACN prevalence of 0.7%, 1.3%, 2.7%, 6.6%, and 13.2%, respectively. Compared with the borderline risk group, the low-risk group showed a 50.3% reduced risk of ACN. Meanwhile, the moderate, high, and very high risk groups showed 2, 5, and 10-fold increased risk of ACN. The score showed significantly superior discriminative power than the Asian-Pacific colorectal screening score (P = 0.003).
Conclusions: Our scoring model based on both clinical and laboratory risk factors is useful for the prediction of ACN. This score may be used to include adults < 50 years in colonoscopy screening."

Methods: The San Francisco Bay Area Breast Cancer Study (SFBCS) provided data on Hispanic breast cancer case patients (533 US-born, 553 foreign-born) and control participants (464 US-born, 947 foreign-born). These data yielded estimates of relative risk (RR) and attributable risk (AR) separately for US-born and foreign-born women. Nativity-specific absolute risks were estimated by combining RR and AR information with nativity-specific invasive breast cancer incidence and competing mortality rates from the California Cancer Registry and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program to develop the Hispanic risk model (HRM). In independent data, we assessed model calibration through observed/expected (O/E) ratios, and we estimated discriminatory accuracy with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) statistic.
Results: The US-born HRM included age at first full-term pregnancy, biopsy for benign breast disease, and family history of breast cancer; the foreign-born HRM also included age at menarche. The HRM estimated lower risks than the National Cancer Institute's Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) for US-born Hispanic women, but higher risks in foreign-born women. In independent data from the Women's Health Initiative, the HRM was well calibrated for US-born women (observed/expected [O/E] ratio = 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.81 to 1.40), but seemed to overestimate risk in foreign-born women (O/E ratio = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.41 to 1.07).

Using a nested case-control study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, we investigated the improvement in discrimination gained by adding serum biomarker concentrations to risk estimates derived from an existing risk prediction model based on epidemiologic factors. Serum concentrations of sex steroid hormones, metabolic markers, growth factors, adipokines and cytokines were evaluated in a step-wise backward selection process; biomarkers were retained at p < 0.157 indicating improvement in the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Improvement in discrimination was assessed using the C-statistic for all biomarkers alone, and change in C-statistic from addition of biomarkers to preexisting absolute risk estimates. We used internal validation with bootstrapping (1000-fold) to adjust for over-fitting. Adiponectin, estrone, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and triglycerides were selected into the model. After accounting for over-fitting, discrimination was improved by 2.0 percentage points when all evaluated biomarkers were included and 1.7 percentage points in the model including the selected biomarkers.

Screening individuals with new-onset diabetes might allow earlier diagnosis of PDA. We sought to develop and validate a PDA risk prediction model to identify high-risk individuals among those with new-onset diabetes.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a population representative database from the United Kingdom. Individuals with incident diabetes after the age of 35 years and 3 or more years of follow-up after diagnosis of diabetes were eligible for inclusion. Candidate predictors consisted of epidemiologic and clinical characteristics available at the time of diabetes diagnosis. Variables with P values <.25 in the univariable analyses were evaluated using backward stepwise approach. Model discrimination was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Calibration was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Results were internally validated using a bootstrapping procedure.
Results: We analyzed data from 109,385 patients with new-onset diabetes. Among them, 390 (0.4%) were diagnosed with PDA within 3 years. The final model (area under the curve, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.89) included age, body mass index, change in body mass index, smoking, use of proton pump inhibitors, and anti-diabetic medications, as well as levels of hemoglobin A1C, cholesterol, hemoglobin, creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase. Bootstrapping validation showed negligible optimism. If the predicted risk threshold for definitive PDA screening was set at 1% over 3 years, only 6.19% of the new-onset diabetes population would undergo definitive screening, which would identify patients with PDA with 44.7% sensitivity, 94.0% specificity, and a positive predictive value of 2.6%.
Conclusions: We developed a risk model based on widely available clinical parameters to help identify patients with new-onset diabetes who might benefit from PDA screening."

Methods: A hospital-based case-control study (n = 480) was conducted in Pune, India. We assessed risk factors for UADT cancers by administering a questionnaire through face-to-face interviews. We developed a risk factor model based on the statistically significant risk factors in multiple logistic regression. A total, single risk score was calculated per individual based on the adjusted odds ratio for each of their risk factors. Standard receiver operator characteristic curve was plotted for the total score and the presence of UADT cancers. The stratification ability of the model was determined using the c-statistic. The optimal criterion value was determined at the point on curve at which the Youden's index was maximal. Confidence intervals were calculated by bootstrapping.
Results: Total risk score for each individual ranged from 0 to 26. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95.8; P < 0.001) suggests strong predictive ability. A risk score criterion value of 鈮10 produced optimal sensitivity (93.5%), specificity (71.1%), false-positive rate (28.8%), false-negative rate (6.4%), positive predictive value (74.8%), and negative predictive value (96.6%).

Methods: Indeterminate nodules up to 2 cm with uncertain malignant potential detected on computed tomography of cirrhotic liver during HCC surveillance were analyzed retrospectively. HCC risk prediction model of indeterminate nodules in HBV-related cirrhotic liver was deduced based on result of Cox regression analysis.
Results: A total of 494 indeterminate nodules were included. Independent risk factors of HCC progression were old age, arterial enhancement, large nodule size, low serum albumin level, high serum 伪-fetoprotein (AFP) level, and prior HCC history in all included subjects. In subjects with chronic hepatitis B, old age (year; hazard ratio (HR)=1.06; P<0.001), arterial enhancement (HR=2.62; P=0.005), large nodule size (>1 cm; HR=7.34; P<0.001), low serum albumin level (鈮3.5 g/dl; HR=3.57; P=0.001), high serum AFP level (鈮100 ng/ml; HR=6.04; P=0.006), prior HCC history (HR=4.24; P=0.001), and baseline hepatitis B e antigen positivity (HR=2.31; P=0.007) were associated with HCC progression. We developed a simple risk prediction model using these risk factors and identified patients at low, intermediate, and high risk for HCC; 5-year cumulative incidences were 1%, 14.5%, and 63.1%, respectively. The developed risk score model showed good performance with area under the curve at 0.886 at 3 years, and 0.920 at 5 years in leave-one-out cross-validation.

Results: PCA3 is associated with cancer detection on MRF-TB for men with no prior biopsies (area under the curve: 0.67, 95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.76). Using a cutoff of 鈮35, PCA3 was associated with cancer risk among men with mSS 2-3 (P = .004), but not among those with mSS 4-5 (P = .340). The interaction of PCA3 and mSS demonstrated significantly higher discrimination for cancer than mSS alone (area under the curve: 0.83 vs 0.79, P = .0434).
Conclusion: Urinary PCA3 is associated with mSS and the detection of cancer on MRF-TB for men with no prior biopsies. PCA3 notably demonstrates a high negative predictive value among mSS 2-3. However, in the case of high-suspicion mpMRI, PCA3 is not associated with cancer detection on MRF-TB, adding little to cancer diagnosis.

Patients and methods: The risk of prostate cancer (PCa) and significant PCa (Gleason score 鈮7) in 2001 patients from six tertiary referral centres was calculated according to the PCPT-RC and ERSPC-RC formulae. The calculators' predictions were analysed using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plots, Hosmer-Lemeshow test for goodness of fit and decision-curve analysis. In a subset of 222 patients for whom the PHI score was available, each patient's risk was calculated as per the ERSPC-RC and ERSPC-PHI risk calculators.
Results: The ERSPC-RC outperformed the PCPT-RC in the prediction of PCa, with an AUC of 0.71 compared with 0.64, and also outperformed the PCPT-RC in the prediction of significant PCa (P<0.001), with an AUC of 0.74 compared with 0.69. The ERSPC-RC was found to have improved calibration in this cohort and was associated with a greater net benefit on decision-curve analysis for both PCa and significant PCa. The performance of the ERSPC-RC was further improved through the addition of the PHI score in a subset of 222 patients. The AUCs of the ERSPC-PHI were 0.76 and 0.78 for PCa and significant PCa prediction, respectively, in comparison with AUC values of 0.72 in the prediction of both PCa and significant PCa for the ERSPC-RC (P = 0.12 and P = 0.04, respectively). The ERSPC-PHI risk calculator was well calibrated in this cohort and had an increase in net benefit over that of the ERSPC-RC.
Conclusions: The performance of the risk calculators in the present cohort shows that the ERSPC-RC is a superior tool in the prediction of PCa; however the performance of the ERSPC-RC in this population does not yet warrant its use in clinical practice. The incorporation of the PHI score into the ERSPC-PHI risk calculator allowed each patient's risk to be more accurately quantified.

Materials and Methods All authors received approval for use of NLST data. An institutional review board exemption and a waiver for informed consent were granted to the author with an academic appointment. Nodule characteristics and patient attributes with regard to benign and malignant nodules in the NLST were applied to a nodule risk calculator from a group in Vancouver, Canada. Patient populations and their nodule characteristics were compared between the NLST and Vancouver cohorts. Multiple thresholds were tested to distinguish benign nodules from malignant nodules. An optimized threshold value was used to determine positive and negative predictive values, and a full logistic regression model was applied to the NLST data set. Results Sufficient data were available for 4431 nodules (4315 benign nodules and 116 malignant nodules) from the NLST data set. The NLST and Vancouver data sets differed in that the former included fewer nodules per study, fewer nonsolid nodules, and more nodule spiculation and emphysema. A composite risk score threshold of 10% was determined to be optimal, demonstrating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 85.3%, 93.9%, 27.4%, and 99.6%, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic curve for the full regression model applied to the NLST database demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.963 (95% confidence interval: 0.945, 0.974).

Background: Although consensus guidelines list several malignancy predicting factors in patients with BD-IPMN, those variables have different predictability and individual quantitative prediction of malignancy risk is limited.
Methods: Clinicopathological factors predictive of malignancy were retrospectively analyzed in 2525 patients with biopsy proven BD-IPMN at 22 tertiary hospitals in Korea and Japan. The patients with main duct dilatation >10 mm and inaccurate information were excluded.
Results: The study cohort consisted of 2258 patients. Malignant IPMNs were defined as those with high grade dysplasia and associated invasive carcinoma. Of 2258 patients, 986 (43.7%) had low, 443 (19.6%) had intermediate, 398 (17.6%) had high grade dysplasia, and 431 (19.1%) had invasive carcinoma. To construct and validate the nomogram, patients were randomly allocated into training and validation sets, with fixed ratios of benign and malignant lesions. Multiple logistic regression analysis resulted in five variables (cyst size, duct dilatation, mural nodule, serum CA19-9, and CEA) being selected to construct the nomogram. In the validation set, this nomogram showed excellent discrimination power through a 1000 times bootstrapped calibration test.

The contributions of the PRS and variables in the BCSC model to breast cancer risk were tested using conditional logistic regression. Discriminatory accuracy of the models was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Increasing quartiles of the PRS were positively associated with breast cancer risk, with OR 2.54 (95 % CI 1.69-3.82) for breast cancer in the highest versus lowest quartile. In a multivariable model, the PRS, family history, and breast density remained strong risk factors. The AUROC of the PRS was 0.60 (95 % CI 0.57-0.64), and an Asian-specific PRS had AUROC 0.64 (95 % CI 0.53-0.74).

Objective: To develop and externally validate a risk prediction model for incident first-primary cutaneous melanoma using self-assessed risk factors.
Design, setting, and participants: We used unconditional logistic regression to develop a multivariable risk prediction model. Relative risk estimates from the model were combined with Australian melanoma incidence and competing mortality rates to obtain absolute risk estimates. A risk prediction model was developed using the Australian Melanoma Family Study (629 cases and 535 controls) and externally validated using 4 independent population-based studies: the Western Australia Melanoma Study (511 case-control pairs), Leeds Melanoma Case-Control Study (960 cases and 513 controls), Epigene-QSkin Study (44 544, of which 766 with melanoma), and Swedish Women's Lifestyle and Health Cohort Study (49 259 women, of which 273 had melanoma).
Main outcomes and measures: We validated model performance internally and externally by assessing discrimination using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Additionally, using the Swedish Women's Lifestyle and Health Cohort Study, we assessed model calibration and clinical usefulness.
Results: The risk prediction model included hair color, nevus density, first-degree family history of melanoma, previous nonmelanoma skin cancer, and lifetime sunbed use. On internal validation, the AUC was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.67-0.73). On external validation, the AUC was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.63-0.69) in the Western Australia Melanoma Study, 0.67 (95% CI, 0.65-0.70) in the Leeds Melanoma Case-Control Study, 0.64 (95% CI, 0.62-0.66) in the Epigene-QSkin Study, and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.60-0.67) in the Swedish Women's Lifestyle and Health Cohort Study. Model calibration showed close agreement between predicted and observed numbers of incident melanomas across all deciles of predicted risk. In the external validation setting, there was higher net benefit when using the risk prediction model to classify individuals as high risk compared with classifying all individuals as high risk.

Objective: To develop a multimodal model, incorporating previously identified messenger RNA (mRNA) biomarkers and traditional risk factors that could be used to identify patients with high-grade PCa (Gleason score 鈮7) on prostate biopsy.
Design, setting, and participants: In two prospective multicenter studies, urine was collected for mRNA profiling after digital rectal examination (DRE) and prior to prostate biopsy. The multimodal risk score was developed on a first cohort (n=519) and subsequently validated clinically in an independent cohort (n=386).
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The mRNA levels were measured using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression was used to model patient risk and combine risk factors. Models were compared using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic, and clinical utility was evaluated with a decision curve analysis (DCA).
Results and limitations: HOXC6 and DLX1 mRNA levels were shown to be good predictors for the detection of high-grade PCa. The multimodal approach reached an overall AUC of 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.95) in the validation cohort (AUC 0.86 in the training cohort), with the mRNA signature, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density, and previous cancer-negative prostate biopsies as the strongest, most significant components, in addition to nonsignificant model contributions of PSA, age, and family history. For another model, which included DRE as an additional risk factor, an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.80-0.92) was obtained (AUC 0.90 in the training cohort). Both models were successfully validated, with no significant change in AUC in the validation cohort, and DCA indicated a strong net benefit and the best reduction in unnecessary biopsies compared with other clinical decision-making tools, such as the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator and the PCA3 assay.
Conclusions: The risk score based on the mRNA liquid biopsy assay combined with traditional clinical risk factors identified men at risk of harboring high-grade PCa and resulted in a better patient risk stratification compared with current methods in clinical practice. Therefore, the risk score could reduce the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies.
Patient summary: This study evaluated a novel urine-based assay that could be used as a noninvasive diagnostic aid for high-grade prostate cancer (PCa).

The aim of our study was to validate the most prominent genetic risk loci in an independent Greek melanoma case-control dataset and to assess their cumulative effect solely or combined with established phenotypic risk factors on individualized risk prediction. We genotyped 59 SNPs in 800 patients and 800 controls and tested their association with melanoma using logistic regression analyses. We constructed a weighted genetic risk score (GRSGWS) based on SNPs that showed genome-wide significant (GWS) association with melanoma in previous studies and assessed their impact on risk prediction. Fifteen independent SNPs from 12 loci were significantly associated with melanoma (P < 0.05). Risk score analysis yielded an odds ratio of 1.36 per standard deviation increase of the GRSGWS (P = 1.1 脳 10(-7)). Individuals in the highest 20% of the GRSGWS had a 1.88-fold increase in melanoma risk compared with those in the middle quintile. By adding the GRSGWS to a phenotypic risk model, the C-statistic increased from 0.764 to 0.775 (P = 0.007). In summary, the GRSGWS is associated with melanoma risk and achieves a modest improvement in risk prediction when added to a phenotypic risk model."

Resulting risk estimates are presented in simple language and graphic formats for easy comprehension. iPrevent(庐) then presents risk-adapted, evidence-based, guideline-endorsed management options. Development was an iterative process with regular feedback from multidisciplinary experts and consumers. To verify iPrevent(庐), risk factor data for 127 cases derived from the Australian Breast Cancer Family Study were entered into iPrevent(庐), IBIS (v7.02), and BOADICEA (v3.0). Consistency of the model chosen by iPrevent(庐) (i.e., IBIS or BOADICEA) with the programmed iPrevent(庐) model choice algorithm was assessed. Estimated breast cancer risks from iPrevent(庐) were compared with those attained directly from the chosen risk assessment model (IBIS or BOADICEA). Risk management interventions displayed by iPrevent(庐) were assessed for appropriateness. Risk estimation model choice was 100 % consistent with the programmed iPrevent(庐) logic. Discrepant 10-year and residual lifetime risk estimates of >1 % were found for 1 and 4 cases, respectively, none was clinically significant (maximal variation 1.4 %). Risk management interventions suggested by iPrevent(庐) were 100 % appropriate. iPrevent(庐) successfully integrates the IBIS and BOADICEA risk assessment models into a decision support tool that provides evidence-based, risk-adapted risk management advice.

To develop a prediction tool, we used baseline data from a prospective cohort study (n = 38,726) in Queensland, Australia, and used data linkage to capture all surgically excised keratinocyte carcinomas arising within the cohort. Predictive factors were identified through stepwise logistic regression models. In secondary analyses, we derived separate models within strata of prior skin cancer history, age, and sex. The primary model included terms for 10 items. Factors with the strongest effects were >20 prior skin cancers excised (odds ratio 8.57, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 6.73-10.91), >50 skin lesions destroyed (odds ratio 3.37, 95% CI 2.85-3.99), age 鈮 70 years (odds ratio 3.47, 95% CI 2.53-4.77), and fair skin color (odds ratio 1.75, 95% CI 1.42-2.15).

To aid the development of a personalized prevention strategy, we developed a risk-prediction model and estimated absolute risks stratified by a combination of the ALDH2 genotype and alcohol consumption. We carried out two age-matched and sex-matched case-control studies: one (630 cases and 1260 controls) for model derivation and the second (654 cases and 654 controls) for external validation. On the basis of data from the derivation study, a prediction model was developed by fitting a conditional logistic regression model using the following predictors: age, sex, smoking, drinking, and the ALDH2 genotype. The risk model, including a combination of the ALDH2 genotype and alcohol consumption, provided high discriminatory accuracy and good calibration in both the derivation and the validation studies: C statistics were 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.80-0.84) and 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.81-0.85), respectively, and the calibration plots of both studies remained close to the ideal calibration line. Cumulative risks were obtained by combining odds ratios estimated from the risk model with the age-specific incidence rate and population size. For heavy drinkers with a heterozygous genotype, the cumulative risk at age 80 was above 20%. In contrast, risk in the other groups was less than 5%. In conclusion, modification of alcohol consumption according to the ALDH2 genotype will have a major impact on upper aerodigestive tract cancer prevention.

From random sampling of 2,000 participants, the independent risk factors were evaluated for PN using binary regression analysis. The odds ratios for significant risk factors were used to develop a scoring system, with scores stratified into 'average risk' (AR):0-2 and 'high risk' (HR):3-5. The other 3,789 subjects formed an independent validation cohort. Each participant received a score calculated based on their risk factors. The performance of the scoring system was evaluated. The proportion of PN in the derivation and validation cohorts was 12.6% and 12.9%, respectively. Based on age, gender, family history, body mass index and self-reported ischaemic heart disease, 85.0% and 15.0% in the validation cohort were classified as AR and HR, respectively.

Computer adaptive testing may offer advantages over non-adaptive testing, including reduction of numbers of items required for precise measurement.
Objective: Our aim was to compare the efficiency of non-adaptive (NAT) and computer adaptive testing (CAT) facilitated by Partial Credit Model (PCM)-derived calibration to estimate skin cancer risk.
Methods: We used a random sample from a population-based Australian cohort study of skin cancer risk (N=43,794). All 30 items of the skin cancer risk scale were calibrated with the Rasch PCM. A total of 1000 cases generated following a normal distribution (mean [SD] 0 [1]) were simulated using three Rasch models with three fixed-item (dichotomous, rating scale, and partial credit) scenarios, respectively. We calculated the comparative efficiency and precision of CAT and NAT (shortening of questionnaire length and the count difference number ratio less than 5% using independent t tests).
Results: We found that use of CAT led to smaller person standard error of the estimated measure than NAT, with substantially higher efficiency but no loss of precision, reducing response burden by 48%, 66%, and 66% for dichotomous, Rating Scale Model, and PCM models, respectively.
Conclusions: CAT-based administrations of the skin cancer risk scale could substantially reduce participant burden without compromising measurement precision. A mobile computer adaptive test was developed to help people efficiently assess their skin cancer risk."

Logistic regression, adjusting for age group, was used to estimate risk associations with log-transformed age-adjusted 5-year risks. Discrimination was measured by the odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation (SD) and the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC). When considered alone, the ORs for African American women were 1.28 for BCRAT, and 1.04 for IBIS. When combined with the SNP risk score (OR 1.23), the corresponding ORs were 1.39 and 1.22.

Materials and methods: We prospectively enrolled 87 patients with 91 tumors patients (mean, 49.6 years; range, 29-74 years) who underwent definitive surgery. We defined estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors with low histologic grade (HG), low Ki67 (<14%), and negative lymph node metastasis as a low-risk breast cancer. We obtained quantitative and semiquantitative perfusion parameters and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for all tumors. We compared perfusion parameters and ADCs between low-risk tumors (n=33; 36%) and the others (n=58; 64%) using Fisher's exact test, Chi-square test, and student t-test. We developed empirical model to predict low-risk tumor using logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis.
Results: On univariate analysis, wash-in and the initial area under the curve on qualitative analysis (iAUCqualitative) were significantly different according to HG, ER, HER-2, Ki67 and lymphovascular invasion (P<.05 for all variables). ADCdiff was significantly different according to HG, HER-2, and Ki67 status (P=.010, .007, and .013). On multivariate analysis, Ktrans, iAUCqualitative, and ADCdiff were the significant variables for the prediction of low-risk tumors, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of combined parameters was 0.78, which was higher than those of the individual parameter. ADCdiff was positively correlated with wash-in (r=0.263) and iAUCqualitative (r=0.245), respectively.
Conclusion: The prediction model using Ktrans, wash in, iAUCqualitative, and ADCdiff on DCE-MRI and DWI could be helpful for identifying of low-risk breast cancer and may be used as an imaging biomarker to guide the treatment plan."

We evaluated the benefit of including mammographic density and the cumulative effect of genetic variants in breast cancer risk prediction among women in a Singapore population.
Methods: We estimated the risk of breast cancer using a prospective cohort of 24,161 women aged 50 to 64 from Singapore with available mammograms and known risk factors for breast cancer who were recruited between 1994 and 1997. We measured mammographic density using the medio-lateral oblique views of both breasts. Each woman's genotype for 75 SNPs was simulated based on the genotype frequency obtained from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium data and the cumulative effect was summarized by a genetic risk score (GRS). Any improvement in the performance of our proposed prediction model versus one containing only variables from the Gail model was assessed by changes in receiver-operating characteristic and predictive values.
Results: During 17 years of follow-up, 680 breast cancer cases were diagnosed. The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 1.60 (1.22-2.10), 2.20 (1.65-2.92), 2.33 (1.71-3.20), 2.12 (1.43-3.14), and 3.27 (2.24-4.76) for the corresponding mammographic density categories: 11-20cm2, 21-30cm2, 31-40cm2, 41-50cm2, 51-60cm2, and 1.10 (1.03-1.16) for GRS. At the predicted absolute 10-year risk thresholds of 2.5% and 3.0%, a model with mammographic density and GRS could correctly identify 0.9% and 0.5% more women who would develop the disease compared to a model using only the Gail variables, respectively.
Conclusion: Mammographic density and common genetic variants can improve the discriminatory power of an established breast cancer risk prediction model among females in Singapore."

To improve treatment, current oncology research focuses on discovering and validating new biomarkers for early detection of cancer; so far with limited success. Metabolic profiling of plasma samples and auxiliary lifestyle information was combined by chemometric data fusion. It was possible to create a biocontour, which we define as a complex pattern of relevant biological and phenotypic information. While single markers or known risk factors have close to no predictive value, the developed biocontour provides a forecast which, several years before diagnosis, is on par with how well most current biomarkers can diagnose current cancer. Hence, while e.g. mammography can diagnose current cancer with a sensitivity and specificity of around 75 %, the currently developed biocontour can predict that there is an increased risk that breast cancer will develop in a subject 2-5 years after the sample is taken with sensitivity and specificity well above 80 %.

Objectives: To compare two PCa risk calculators (RCs) that include PHI.
Design, setting, and participants: We evaluated the predictive performance of a previously developed PHI-based nomogram and updated versions of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) RCs based on digital rectal examination (DRE): RC3 (no prior biopsy) and RC4 (prior biopsy). For the ERSPC updates, the original RCs were recalibrated and PHI was added as a predictor. The PHI-updated ERSPC RCs were compared with the Lughezzani nomogram in 1185 men from four European sites. Outcomes were biopsy-detectable PC and potentially advanced or aggressive PCa, defined as clinical stage >T2b and/or a Gleason score 鈮7 (clinically relevant PCa).
Results and limitations: The PHI-updated ERSPC models had a combined area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.72 for all PCa and 0.68 for clinically relevant PCa. For the Lughezzani PHI-based nomogram, AUCs were 0.75 for all PCa and 0.69 for clinically relevant PCa.

Methods: Life-course data collected from a multicentre case-control study in India were used. Interview was conducted to collect information on predictors limited to the time before the onset of symptoms or cancer diagnosis. Predictors included statistically significant risk factors in the multivariable model. A risk score for each predictor was derived from respective odds ratios (OR). Discrimination of the final model, risk scores and various risk score cut-offs was examined using the c statistic. The optimal cut-off was determined as the one with good area under curve (AUC) and high sensitivity. Predictive ability of the regression model and cut-off risk score was determined by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). Models were validated from a bootstrap sample.
Results: Smoking, chewing quid and/or tobacco, alcohol, a family history of upper aero-digestive tract cancer, diet and oral hygiene behaviour were the predictors. Risk scores ranged from 0 to 28. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for risk scores was good (0.866). The sensitivity (0.928) and negative predictive value (0.927) were high, while specificity (0.603) and positive predictive value (0.607) were low for a risk score cut-off of 6.

We incorporated benign breast disease (BBD) diagnoses into the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) risk model, the only breast cancer risk assessment tool that uses breast density.
Methods: We developed and validated a competing-risk model using 2000 to 2010 SEER data for breast cancer incidence and 2010 vital statistics to adjust for the competing risk of death. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the relative hazards for age, race/ethnicity, family history of breast cancer, history of breast biopsy, BBD diagnoses, and breast density in the BCSC.
Results: We included 1,135,977 women age 35 to 74 years undergoing mammography with no history of breast cancer; 17% of the women had a prior breast biopsy. During a mean follow-up of 6.9 years, 17,908 women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. The BCSC BBD model slightly overpredicted risk (expected-to-observed ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.06) and had modest discriminatory accuracy (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, 0.665). Among women with proliferative findings, adding BBD to the model increased the proportion of women with an estimated 5-year risk of 3% or higher from 9.3% to 27.8% (P<.001).
Conclusion: The BCSC BBD model accurately estimates women's risk for breast cancer using breast density and BBD diagnoses. Greater numbers of high-risk women eligible for primary prevention after BBD diagnosis are identified using the BCSC BBD model."

For prostate cancer it is unknown if inclusion of genetic markers that have so far not been associated with prostate cancer risk at a genome-wide significant level will improve disease prediction.
Methods: We built polygenic risk scores in a large training set comprising over 25,000 individuals. Initially 65 established prostate cancer susceptibility variants were selected. After LD pruning additional variants were prioritized based on their association with prostate cancer. Six-fold cross validation was performed to assess genetic risk scores and optimize the number of additional variants to be included. The final model was evaluated in an independent study population including 1,370 cases and 1,239 controls.
Results: The polygenic risk score with 65 established susceptibility variants provided an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.67. Adding an additional 68 novel variants significantly increased the AUC to 0.68 (P = 0.0012) and the net reclassification index with 0.21 (P = 8.5E-08).

Among the eligibility criteria, the DLCST produced the highest sensitivity (64.13%), whereas the NLST produced the highest specificity (93.13%) and PPV (2.88%). The PLCO(M2012) model showed the best performance in external validation (C-index: 0.81; 95% CI, 0.76-0.86; E/O: 1.03; 95% CI, 0.87-1.23) and the highest sensitivity, specificity, and PPV, but the superiority over the Bach model and the LLP model was modest. All the models but the Spitz model showed greater net benefit over the full range of risk estimates than the eligibility criteria. We concluded that all of the lung cancer risk prediction models apart from the Spitz model have a similar accuracy to identify high-risk individuals for screening, but in general outperform the eligibility criteria used in the screening trials."

To illustrate the potential impact of risk factor modification in model-based risk assessment, we evaluated the performance of the IBIS Breast Cancer Risk Evaluation Tool, with and without current body mass index (BMI), for predicting future breast cancer occurrence in a prospective cohort of 665 postmenopausal women. Overall, IBIS's accuracy (overall agreement between observed and assigned risks) and discrimination (AUC concordance between assigned risks and outcomes) were similar with and without the BMI information. However, in women with BMI > 25 kg/m(2), adding BMI information improved discrimination (AUC = 63.9 % and 61.4 % with and without BMI, P < 0.001). The model-assigned 10-year risk difference for a woman with high (27 kg/m(2)) versus low (21 kg/m(2)) BMI was only 0.3 % for a woman with neither affected first-degree relatives nor BRCA1 mutation, compared to 4.5 % for a mutation carrier with three such relatives.

Methods: We included consecutive patients who underwent prostate biopsies in two tertiary centers between 2012 and 2014. GRS was calculated using 24 PCa-associated genetic variants and its predictiveness was assessed by area under curve (AUC).
Results: Of 1120 men tested, 724 with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 20 ng/ml were selected for further analysis. Patients were divided into 3 groups by age cutoffs at 60 and 70 years. GRS significantly predicted PCa for all patients (AUC: 0.561; 95% CI: 0.514-0.609) and was an independent predictor in multivariate analysis for the 60-70 year-olds (AUC: 0.612, 95% CI: 0.541-0.684), but not for patients aged < 60 years or 鈮 70 years.

Yearly data from five international prostate biopsy cohorts (3 in the US, 1 in Austria, 1 in England) were used to compare 6 methods for annual risk prediction: static use of the online US-developed Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator (PCPTRC); recalibration of the PCPTRC; revision of the PCPTRC; building a new model each year using logistic regression, Bayesian prior-to-posterior updating, or random forests. All methods performed similarly with respect to discrimination, except for random forests, which were worse. All methods except for random forests greatly improved calibration over the static PCPTRC in all cohorts except for Austria, where the PCPTRC had the best calibration followed closely by recalibration.

Objective: Validate logistic regression models, termed Mi-Prostate Score (MiPS), that incorporate serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA; or the multivariate Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator version 1.0 [PCPTrc]) and urine T2:ERG and PCA3 scores for predicting PCa and high-grade PCa on biopsy.
Design, setting, and participants: T2:ERG and PCA3 scores were generated using clinical-grade transcription-mediated amplification assays. Pretrained MiPS models were applied to a validation cohort of whole urine samples prospectively collected after digital rectal examination from 1244 men presenting for biopsy.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Area under the curve (AUC) was used to compare the performance of serum PSA (or the PCPTrc) alone and MiPS models. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to assess clinical benefit.
Results and limitations: Among informative validation cohort samples (n=1225 [98%], 80% from patients presenting for initial biopsy), models incorporating T2:ERG had significantly greater AUC than PSA (or PCPTrc) for predicting PCa (PSA: 0.693 vs 0.585; PCPTrc: 0.718 vs 0.639; both p<0.001) or high-grade (Gleason score >6) PCa on biopsy (PSA: 0.729 vs 0.651, p<0.001; PCPTrc: 0.754 vs 0.707, p=0.006). MiPS models incorporating T2:ERG score had significantly greater AUC (all p<0.001) than models incorporating only PCA3 plus PSA (or PCPTrc or high-grade cancer PCPTrc [PCPThg]). DCA demonstrated net benefit of the MiPS_PCPTrc (or MiPS_PCPThg) model compared with the PCPTrc (or PCPThg) across relevant threshold probabilities.
Conclusions: Incorporating urine T2:ERG and PCA3 scores improves the performance of serum PSA (or PCPTrc) for predicting PCa and high-grade PCa on biopsy.
Patient summary: Incorporation of two prostate cancer (PCa)-specific biomarkers (TMPRSS2:ERG and PCA3) measured in the urine improved on serum prostate-specific antigen (or a multivariate risk calculator) for predicting the presence of PCa and high-grade PCa on biopsy. A combined test, Mi-Prostate Score, uses models validated in this study and is clinically available to provide individualized risk estimates."

A step-wise model selection process was used to select confirmed predictive epidemiologic risk factors. Piece-wise constant hazard rates in 5-year age-intervals were estimated in a cause-specific competing risks model, five-fold-cross-validation was applied for internal validation. Risk factors included in the risk prediction model were body-mass index (BMI), menopausal status, age at menarche and at menopause, oral contraceptive use, overall and by different BMI categories and overall duration of use, parity, age at first full-term pregnancy, duration of menopausal hormone therapy and smoking status (specific for pre, peri- and post-menopausal women). These variables improved the discriminating capacity to predict risk over 5 years from 71% for a model based on age alone to 77% (overall C statistic), and the model was well-calibrated (ratio of expected to observed cases = 0.99).

Methods: Predicted odds of melanoma were estimated by analyzing a pooled dataset from 16 case-control studies using logistic random coefficients models. Risk categories were defined based on the distribution of the predicted odds in the controls from these studies. Imputation was used to estimate missing data in the pooled datasets. The 30th, 60th, and 90th centiles were used to distribute individuals into four risk groups for their age, sex, and geographic location. Cross-validation was used to test the robustness of the thresholds for each group by leaving out each study one by one. Performance of the model was assessed in an independent UK case-control study dataset.
Results: Cross-validation confirmed the robustness of the threshold estimates. Cases and controls were well discriminated in the independent dataset [area under the curve, 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73-0.78]. Twenty-nine percent of cases were in the highest risk group compared with 7% of controls, and 43% of controls were in the lowest risk group compared with 13% of cases.

Results: Our results indicate that lung cancer risk factors included older age, male gender, lower education level, family history of cancer, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower body mass index, smoking cigarettes, a diet with less seafood, vegetables, fruits, dairy products, soybean products and nuts, a diet rich in meat, and exposure to pesticides and cooking emissions. The area under the curve was 0.8851 and the optimal operating point was obtained. With a cutoff of 0.35, the false positive rate, true positive rate, and Youden index were 0.21, 0.87, and 0.66, respectively.
Conclusions: The risk prediction model for lung cancer developed in this study could discriminate high-risk from low-risk individuals."

The focus of the reported work is on the development of an integrated risk prediction model using a two-level fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) model. The proposed model combines the results of the initial screening mammogram of the given woman with her demographic risk factors to predict the post-screening risk of developing BC.
Methods: The level-1 FCM models the demographic risk profile. A nonlinear Hebbian learning algorithm is used to train this model and thus to help on predicting the BC risk grade based on demographic risk factors identified by domain experts. The risk grades estimated by the proposed model are validated using two standard BC risk assessment models viz. Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick. The level-2 FCM models the features of the screening mammogram concerning normal, benign and malignant cases. The data driven Hebbian learning algorithm (DDNHL) is used to train this model in order to predict the BC risk grade based on these mammographic image features. An overall risk grade is calculated by combining the outcomes of these two FCMs.
Results: The main limitation of the Gail model of underestimating the risk level of women with strong family history is overcome by the proposed model. IBIS is a hard computing tool based on the Tyrer-Cuzick model that is comprehensive enough in covering a wide range of demographic risk factors including family history, but it generates results in terms of numeric risk score based on predefined formulae. Thus the outcome is difficult to interpret by naive users. Besides these models are based only on the demographic details and do not take into account the findings of the screening mammogram. The proposed integrated model overcomes the above described limitations of the existing models and predicts the risk level in terms of qualitative grades. The predictions of the proposed NHL-FCM model comply with the Tyrer-Cuzick model for 36 out of 40 patient cases. With respect to tumor grading, the overall classification accuracy of DDNHL-FCM using 70 real mammogram screening images is 94.3%. The testing accuracy of the proposed model using 10-fold cross validation technique outperforms other standard machine learning based inference engines.
Conclusion: In the perspective of clinical oncologists, this is a comprehensive front-end medical decision support system that assists them in efficiently assessing the expected post-screening BC risk level of the given individual and hence prescribing individualized preventive interventions and more intensive surveillance for high risk women."

Study design: 149 patients with AEH diagnosed by D&C specimens or hysteroscopy undergoing total hysterectomy were enrolled in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into two groups: 51 cases in AEH to AEH group and 98 cases in AEH to EC group. The clinical pathological characteristics were compared between the two groups. With the use of ROC curves, cutoff values of age, CA199, CA125 and uterine height were determined. The relationships of these evaluators with endometrial carcinogenesis were investigated by multivariate analysis with a logistic regression model.
Results: 65.8% (98/149) of preoperative AEH patients become EC after confirmed by paraffin hysterectomy specimens. The cutoff values were 51.5 years of age, 14.06U/ml of CA199, 14.30U/ml of CA125 and 45mm of uterine height, respectively. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated age (OR=0.58, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 0.08-3.94), CA199 (OR=7.27, 95%CI: 1.43-36.92), CA125 (OR=13.97, 95%CI: 2.49-78.37), uterine height (OR=0.49, 95%CI: 0.08-3.08) and abnormal uterine bleeding (OR=4.27, 95%CI: 0.53-34.52) were associated with endometrial carcinogenesis. However, only CA199 (p=0.017) and CA125 (p=0.003) revealed significant differences. Therefore, when entered into the risk model, CA199鈮14.06U/ml and CA125鈮14.30U/ml were considered as cogent predictors of endometrial carcinogenesis.
Conclusions: This risk model may well predict the probability of endometrial carcinogenesis when preoperatively diagnosed as AEH."

To develop risk scores for stratifying average-risk population for mass HCC screening, we conducted a pooled analysis using data from three cohorts involving 12,377 Taiwanese adults 20-80 years of age. During 191,240.3 person-years of follow-up, 387 HCCs occurred. We derived risk scores from Cox's model in two thirds of participants and used another one third for model validation. Besides assessing discrimination and calibration, we performed decision curve analysis to translate findings into public health policy. A risk score according to age, sex, alanine aminotransferase, previous chronic liver disease, family history of HCC, and cumulative smoking had good discriminatory accuracy in both model derivation and validation sets (c-statistics for 3-, 5-, and 10-year risk prediction: 0.76-0.83). It also performed well across cohorts and diverse subgroups. Decision curve analyses revealed that use of the score in selecting persons for screening improved benefit at threshold probabilities of >2% 10-year risk, compared with current guidelines and a strategy of screening all hepatitis B carriers. Using 10-year risk 2% as a threshold for initiating screening, the screening age ranged from 20 to 鈮60 years, depending on the tertile of risk scores and status of hepatitis B/C virus infection. Combining risk-score tertile levels and hepatitis virus status to stratify participants was more sensitive than current guidelines for HCC detection within 10 years (89.4% vs. 76.8%), especially for young-onset HCCs <50 years (79.4% vs. 40.6%), under slightly lower specificity (67.8% vs. 71.8%).
Conclusion: A simple HCC prediction algorithm was developed using accessible variables combined with hepatitis virus status, which allows selection of asymptomatic persons for priority of HCC screening."

There are several means of measuring mammographic density, among which are area-based and volumetric-based approaches. Current volumetric methods use only unprocessed, raw mammograms, which is a problematic restriction since such raw mammograms are normally not stored. We describe fully automated methods for measuring both area and volumetric mammographic density from processed images.
Methods: The data set used in this study comprises raw and processed images of the same view from 1462 women. We developed two algorithms for processed images, an automated area-based approach (CASAM-Area) and a volumetric-based approach (CASAM-Vol). The latter method was based on training a random forest prediction model with image statistical features as predictors, against a volumetric measure, Volpara, for corresponding raw images. We contrast the three methods, CASAM-Area, CASAM-Vol and Volpara directly and in terms of association with breast cancer risk and a known genetic variant for mammographic density and breast cancer, rs10995190 in the gene ZNF365. Associations with breast cancer risk were evaluated using images from 47 breast cancer cases and 1011 control subjects. The genetic association analysis was based on 1011 control subjects.
Results: All three measures of mammographic density were associated with breast cancer risk and rs10995190 (p<0.025 for breast cancer risk and p<1 脳 10(-6) for rs10995190). After adjusting for one of the measures there remained little or no evidence of residual association with the remaining density measures (p>0.10 for risk, p>0.03 for rs10995190).
Conclusions: Our results show that it is possible to obtain reliable automated measures of volumetric and area mammographic density from processed digital images. Area and volumetric measures of density on processed digital images performed similar in terms of risk and genetic association."

For the ADT percentage of correctly classified instances was 71.9%, sensitivity 71.9%, specificity 79.4% and AUC 0.808.
Conclusion: Application of different models for risk assessment and prediction of melanoma should provide efficient and standardized tool in the hands of clinicians. The presented models offer effective discrimination of individuals at high risk, transparent decision making and real-time implementation suitable for clinical practice. A continuous melanoma database growth would provide for further adjustments and enhancements in model accuracy as well as offering a possibility for successful application of more advanced data mining algorithms."

We used data from a national database to develop a personalized risk prediction model for patients with peptic ulcer diseases.
Methods: We collected data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database on 278,898 patients admitted for the first time with a primary diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease. We used the data to develop a nomogram, which we validated by discrimination and calibration, and in a test cohort. Cumulative incidences of study subjects predicted by the nomogram were examined.
Results: In total, 1269 subjects developed gastric cancer. Age, sex, peptic ulcer sites, peptic ulcer complications, Helicobacter pylori eradication, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and surveillance endoscopy were independent factors associated with risk of gastric cancer (all P < .001). The concordance index for the nomogram developed on the basis of these factors was 0.78. Study subjects were divided into quartiles of predicted risk scores; from lowest score quartile to highest, cumulative incidences at 1 year were 7.4/10,000 people, 14.2/10,000 people, 25.5/10,000 people, and 86.6/10,000 people. The cumulative incidences at 2 years were 9.3/10,000 people, 20.9/10,000 people, 38.0/10,000 people, and 135.7/10,000 people for the same quartiles of risk scores. The nomogram was validated in an independent cohort, and similar incidence values were determined.
Conclusions: We developed and validated a nomogram to predict risk for gastric cancer 1 and 2 years after diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease. The nomogram provides a prognostic tool that can be easily used for individuals and can help physicians explain risk levels to patients."

This risk is not uniform because other patient-related factors influence the risk of HCC. The objective of the current study was to develop an HCC risk prediction model to estimate the 1-year probability of HCC to assist with patient counseling.
Methods: Between 2002 and 2011, a cohort of 34,932 patients with cirrhosis was identified from a national liver transplantation waitlist database from the United States. Cox proportional hazards regression methods were used to develop and validate a risk prediction model for incident HCC. In the validation cohort, discrimination and calibration of the model was examined. External validation was conducted using patients with cirrhosis who were enrolled in the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) study.
Results: HCC developed in 1960 patients (5.6%) during a median follow-up of 1.3 years (interquartile range, 0.47 years-2.83 years). Six baseline clinical variables, including age, diabetes, race, etiology of cirrhosis, sex, and severity (ADRESS) of liver dysfunction were independently associated with HCC and were used to develop the ADRESS-HCC risk model. C-indices in the derivation and internal validation cohorts were 0.704 and 0.691, respectively. In the validation cohort, the predicted cumulative incidence of HCC by the ADRESS-HCC model closely matched the observed data. In patients with cirrhosis in the HALT-C cohort, the model stratified patients correctly according to the risk of developing HCC within 5 years.
Conclusions: The ADRESS-HCC risk model is a useful tool for predicting the 1-year risk of HCC among patients with cirrhosis."

552,24722754,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,3.7,MIP is a marker of volumetric density that can be used to complement area PD in mammographic density studies and breast cancer risk assessment.,,Logistic Regression,0.618,,,,,development,Mammograms,,2014,Europe,Sweden,Breast Cancer,"Background: Mammographic density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer.
Methods: We present a novel approach to enhance area density measures that takes advantage of the relative density of the pectoral muscle that appears in lateral mammographic views. We hypothesized that the grey scale of film mammograms is normalized to volume breast density but not pectoral density and thus pectoral density becomes an independent marker of volumetric density.
Results: From analysis of data from a Swedish case-control study (1,286 breast cancer cases and 1,391 control subjects, ages 50-75 years), we found that the mean intensity of the pectoral muscle (MIP) was highly associated with breast cancer risk [per SD: OR = 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75-0.88; P = 6 脳 10(-7)] after adjusting for a validated computer-assisted measure of percent density (PD), Cumulus. The area under curve (AUC) changed from 0.600 to 0.618 due to using PD with the pectoral muscle as reference instead of a standard area-based PD measure. We showed that MIP is associated with a genetic variant known to be associated with mammographic density and breast cancer risk, rs10995190, in a subset of women with genetic data. We further replicated the association between MIP and rs10995190 in an additional cohort of 2,655 breast cancer cases (combined P = 0.0002).
Conclusions: MIP is a marker of volumetric density that can be used to complement area PD in mammographic density studies and breast cancer risk assessment.
Impact: Inclusion of MIP in risk models should be considered for studies using area PD from analog films."

Although guidelines recommend dedicated laboratory tests to rule out tumor functionality, many patients never undergo this workup. This study investigates the use of demographic and clinical variables to create an easy scoring system for predicting adrenal tumor functionality (functional adrenal tumors, or FATs).
Methods: Altogether, 2,807 patients in the NSQIP 2005-2010 database underwent adrenalectomy as their principal operation and had a postoperative diagnosis consistent with an adrenal lesion/disorder. Patients were divided into two groups based on a postoperative diagnosis consistent with tumor functionality. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify specific predictors of FATs and for Cushing's, Conn's, or pheochromocytoma.
Results: Overall, 13.2% (n = 402) of adrenalectomies performed were for FATs. Patients with a FAT were younger (age <40, p < 0.01), overweight (BMI > 30 kg/m(2), p < 0.01), hypertensive (p < 0.001). They also had elevated white blood cells (WBC > 11, p < 0.001), serum creatinine (Cr > 1.25 mg/dl, p < 0.001), and sodium (Na > 143 mmol/L, p < 0.001). On multivariate regression, patients with these characteristics were 20.53 times (CI 15.79-25.27) more likely to have a FAT (model c-statistic 0.634, CI 0.605-0.663; Hosmer-Lemeshow test (H-L), p = 0.035). Patients who were younger (p < 0.001), female (p < 0.001), diabetic (p = 0.07), overweight (p = 0.027), with elevated WBCs (p < 0.001) and lower Cr (p < 0.001) were 63.62 times (CI 58.03-69.21) more likely to have Cushing's (model c-statistic 0.685, CI 0.648-0.722; H-L p = 0.954).
Conclusions: After external validation, this risk estimator might be used to quantify the probability of tumor functionality in patients with incidental adrenal masses. Although predictive power may be limited, it helps identify patients at high risk for FATs that need more urgent referral to a specialist."

Methods: A total of 1,250 patients with chronic hepatitis B and baseline liver stiffness values were recruited between May 2005 and December 2007. The predictive model for HCC occurrence was constructed based on a Cox proportional hazards model. We estimated baseline disease-free probabilities at 3 years. Discrimination and calibration were used to validate the model.
Results: HCC occurred in 56 patients during a median follow-up of 30.7 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that age, male gender, and liver stiffness values were independent predictors of HCC (all P<0.05), whereas hepatitis B virus DNA 鈮20,000 IU/L showed borderline statistical significance (P=0.0659). We developed a predictive model for HCC using these four variables, which showed good discrimination capability, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.806 (95% confidence interval 0.738-0.874). We used the bootstrap method to assess discrimination. The AUROC remained largely unchanged between iterations, with an average value of 0.802 (95% confidence interval 0.791-0.812). The predicted risk of occurrence of HCC calibrated well with the observed risk, with a correlation coefficient of 0.905 (P<0.001).

We developed models to predict the risk of bladder cancer based on clinical and sociodemographic data on participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) screening trial.
Methods: Baseline clinical and sociodemographic data were obtained from 149,542 PLCO participants, ages 55 to 74 years, without a prior history of bladder cancer. Cox proportional hazards models were used to predict the risk of all bladder cancers (ABC) and of high-grade bladder cancers (HGBC) from baseline information. We used the HGBC risk model to design a hypothetical bladder cancer mortality prevention trial.
Results: Over a median follow-up of 12 years, 1,124 men and 259 women developed bladder cancer (including 392 and 72 with HGBC, respectively). The incidence in men and in women was 133.6 and 29.6 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Nomograms constructed for predicting the risk of ABC and HGBC had c-indices of 0.746 and 0.759, respectively. Age, race, education, smoking (intensity and duration), comorbidity, prostatitis, syphilis, and hormone replacement therapy use were statistically significant predictors in the models. We show that our risk model can be used to design a bladder cancer mortality prevention trial half the size of a trial designed without risk stratification.
Conclusion: Models to predict the risk of ABC and HGBC have been developed and validated.
Impact: Using the upper 40th percentile from the HGBC model, a suitable cohort for a screening or chemoprevention trial could be identified, although the size and follow-up of such a trial would be costly."

Methods: Data from 4509 men on the finasteride arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial who were on treatment at the time of their AUASS and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement before biopsy were included in multivariable logistic regression analyses.
Results: Six hundred eighty-two (15.1%) participants had prostate cancer; 257 (37.7%) of these had high-grade disease. For prostate cancer risk, the model included PSA (odds ratio corresponding to a 2-fold increase in PSA: 2.70; P <.0001), digital rectal examination (2.53; P <.0001), age (1.03; P = .001), and prostate volume (odds ratio 0.54 for a 2-fold increase in volume; P <.0001). For high-grade disease, PSA (3.39; P <.0001), digital rectal examination (2.75; P <.0001), age (1.05; P = .001), and volume (0.55; P <.0001) were statistically significant. AUASS was not statistically significant in any of the models that included prostate volume, but was in models in which volume was not included. The number of biopsy cores did not significantly improve risk assessment in any of the models considered.

Results: Our risk model included current smoking (multivariable adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval: 2.20 [1.84-2.62]), heavy alcohol use (>3 drinks/day) (OR: 1.45 [1.19-1.76]), obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m(2)) (OR: 1.26 [1.09-1.45]), diabetes >3 years (nested case-control OR: 1.57 [1.13-2.18], case-control OR: 1.80 [1.40-2.32]), family history of pancreatic cancer (OR: 1.60 [1.20-2.12]), non-O ABO genotype (AO vs. OO genotype) (OR: 1.23 [1.10-1.37]) to (BB vs. OO genotype) (OR 1.58 [0.97-2.59]), rs3790844(chr1q32.1) (OR: 1.29 [1.19-1.40]), rs401681(5p15.33) (OR: 1.18 [1.10-1.26]) and rs9543325(13q22.1) (OR: 1.27 [1.18-1.36]). The areas under the ROC curve for risk models including only non-genetic factors, only genetic factors, and both non-genetic and genetic factors were 58%, 57% and 61%, respectively. We estimate that fewer than 3/1,000 U.S. non-Hispanic whites have more than a 5% predicted lifetime absolute risk.
Conclusion: Although absolute risk modeling using established risk factors may help to identify a group of individuals at higher than average risk of pancreatic cancer, the immediate clinical utility of our model is limited. However, a risk model can increase awareness of the various risk factors for pancreatic cancer, including modifiable behaviors."

It is uncertain whether BOADICEA performs adequately for populations outside the United Kingdom.
Methods: Using a batch mode version of BOADICEA that we developed (BOADICEACentre), we calculated the cumulative 10-year invasive breast cancer risk for 4176 Australian women of European ancestry unaffected at baseline from 1601 case and control families in the Australian Breast Cancer Family Registry. Based on 115 incident breast cancers, we investigated calibration, discrimination (using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves) and accuracy at the individual level.
Results: The ratio of expected to observed number of breast cancers was 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76-1.10). The E/O ratios by subgroups of the participant's relationship to the index case and by the reported number of affected relatives ranged between 0.83 and 0.98 and all 95% CIs included 1.00.

Methods: Tissue sections from 39 prostatectomies were Feulgen-stained and digitally scanned (400脳), providing maps of DNA content per pixel. PCa and benign epithelial nuclei were randomly selected for measurement of 52 basic morphometric features. Logistic regression models discriminating benign from PCa nuclei, and benign from malignant nuclear populations, were built and cross-validated by AUC analysis. Nuclear populations were randomly collected <1 mm or >5 mm from cancer foci, and from cancer-free prostates, HGPIN, and PCa Gleason grade 3-5. Nuclei also were collected from negative biopsy subjects who had a subsequent diagnosis of PCa and age-matched cancer-free controls (20 pairs).
Results: A multi-feature nuclear score discriminated cancer from benign cell populations with AUCs of 0.91 and 0.79, respectively, in training and validation sets of patients. In prostatectomy samples, both nuclear- and population-level models revealed cancer-like features in benign nuclei adjacent to PCa, compared to nuclei that were more distant or from PCa-free glands. In negative biopsies, a validated model with 5 variance features yielded significantly higher scores in cases than controls (P = 0.026).
Conclusions: A multifeature nuclear morphometric score, obtained by automated digital analysis, was validated for discrimination of benign from cancer nuclei. This score demonstrated field effects in benign epithelial nuclei at varying distance from PCa lesions, and was associated with subsequent PCa detection in negative biopsies.
Impact: This nuclear score shows promise as a risk predictor among men with negative biopsies and as an intermediate biomarker in Phase II chemoprevention trials. The results also suggest that subvisual disturbances in nuclear structure precede the development of pre-neoplastic lesions."

573,23645624,Am J Epidemiol,5,This approach provides a strategy for evaluating heterogeneity of risk factor associations by tumor marker levels while controlling for additional tumor markers,,Cox Proportional Hazards Regression,,,,,,development,"Reproductive Factors, Hormone Use, Anthropometric Variables, Benign Breast Disease, And Family History Of Breast Cancer",,2013,America,USA,Breast Cancer,"Relationships between some risk factors and breast cancer incidence are known to vary by tumor subtype. However, breast tumors can be classified according to a number of markers, which may be correlated, making it difficult to identify heterogeneity of risk factors with specific tumor markers when using standard competing-risk survival analysis. In this paper, we propose a constrained competing-risk survival model that allows for assessment of heterogeneity of risk factor associations according to specific tumor markers while controlling for other markers. These methods are applied to Nurses' Health Study data from 1980-2006, during which 3,398 incident invasive breast cancers occurred over 1.4 million person-years of follow-up. Results suggested that when estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status are mutually considered, some risk factors thought to be characteristic of ""estrogen-positive tumors,"" such as high body mass index during postmenopause and increased height, are actually significantly associated with PR-positive tumors but not ER-positive tumors, while other risk factors thought to be characteristic of ""estrogen-negative tumors,"" such as late age at first birth, are actually significantly associated with PR-negative rather than ER-negative breast cancer. This approach provides a strategy for evaluating heterogeneity of risk factor associations by tumor marker levels while controlling for additional tumor markers."

We examined whether these genetic factors, along with non-genetic factors, can contribute to ESCC risk prediction. We examined 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 4 non-genetic factors (sex, age, smoking and drinking) associated with ESCC risk in 9805 cases and 10 493 controls from Chinese populations. Weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) was calculated and logistic regression was used to analyze the association between wGRS and ESCC risk. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to measure the discrimination after adding genetic variants to the model with only non-genetic factors. Net reclassification improvement (NRI) was used to quantify the degree of correct reclassification using different models. wGRS of the combined 17 SNPs with significant marginal effect (G SNPs) increased ~4-fold ESCC risk (P = 1.49 脳 10(-) (164)) and the associations were significant in both drinkers and non-drinkers. However, wGRS of the eight SNPs with significant effect in gene 脳 drinking interaction (GE SNPs) increased ~4-fold ESCC risk only in drinkers (P interaction = 8.76 脳 10(-) (41)). The AUC for a risk model with 4 non-genetic factors, 17 G SNPs, 8 GE SNPs and their interactions with drinking was 70.1%, with the significant improvement of 7.0% compared with the model with only non-genetic factors (P < 0.0001).

This analysis included hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-seropositive and anti-HCV-seronegative participants from the Risk Evaluation of Viral Load Elevation and Associated Liver Disease/Cancer in HBV (R.E.V.E.A.L.-HBV) cohort. Newly developed cirrhosis and HCC were ascertained through regular follow-up ultrasonography, computerized linkage with national health databases, and medical chart reviews. Two-thirds of the participants were allocated for risk model derivation and another one-third for model validation. The risk prediction model included age, gender, HBV e antigen (HBeAg) serostatus, serum levels of HBV DNA, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), quantitative serum HBsAg levels, and HBV genotypes. Additionally, the family history was included in the prediction model for HCC. Cox's proportional hazards regression coefficients for cirrhosis and HCC predictors were converted into risk scores. The areas under receiver operating curve (AUROCs) were used to evaluate the performance of risk models. Elder age, male, HBeAg, genotype C, and increasing levels of ALT, HBV DNA, and HBsAg were all significantly associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis and HCC. The risk scores estimated from the derivation set could accurately categorize participants with low, medium, and high cirrhosis and HCC risk in the validation set (P<0.001). The AUROCs for predicting 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year cirrhosis risk ranged 0.83-0.86 and 0.79-0.82 for the derivation and validation sets, respectively. The AUROC for predicting 5-year, 10-year, 15-year risk of HCC ranged 0.86-0.89 and 0.84-0.87 in the derivation and validation sets, respectively.
Conclusion: The risk prediction models of cirrhosis and HCC by integrating host and HBV profiles have excellent prediction accuracy and discriminatory ability. They may be used for clinical management of chronic hepatitis B patients."

This study examines the impact of including single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alleles in risk prediction for white and African American women undergoing screening mammogram. Using a prospective cohort study, standard risk information and buccal swabs were collected at the time of screening mammography. A 12 SNP panel was performed by deCODE genetics. Five-year and lifetime risks incorporating SNPs were calculated by multiplying estimated Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) risk by the total genetic risk ratio. Concordance between the BCRAT and the combined model (BCRAT + SNPs) in identifying high-risk women was measured using the kappa statistic. SNP data were available for 810 women (39 % African American, 55 % white). The mean BCRAT 5-year risk was 1.71 % for whites and 1.18 % for African Americans. Mean genetic risk ratios were 1.09 in whites and 1.29 in African Americans. Among whites, three SNPs had higher frequencies, and among African Americans, seven SNPs had higher and four had lower high-risk allele frequencies than previously reported. Agreement between the BCRAT and the combined model was relatively low for identifying high-risk women (5-year 魏 = 0.54, lifetime 魏 = 0.36). Addition of SNPs had the greatest effect among African Americans, with 12.4 % identified as having high-5-year risk by BCRAT, but 33 % by the combined model. A greater proportion of African Americans were reclassified as having high-5-year risk than whites using the combined model (21 vs. 10 %). The addition of SNPs to the BCRAT reclassifies the high-risk status of some women undergoing screening mammography, particularly African Americans. Further research is needed to determine the clinical validity and utility of the SNP panel for use in breast cancer risk prediction, particularly among African Americans for whom these risk alleles have generally not been validated."

By contrast, the risk assessment models proposed here include environmental risk factors, family history of NPC, and information on genetic variants. The models were developed using epidemiological and genetic data from a large case-control study, which included 1,387 subjects with NPC and 1,459 controls of Cantonese origin. The predictive accuracy of the models were then assessed by calculating the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC). To compare the discriminatory improvement of models with and without genetic information, we estimated the net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination index (IDI). Well-established environmental risk factors for NPC include consumption of salted fish and preserved vegetables and cigarette smoking (in pack years). The environmental model alone shows modest discriminatory ability (AUC = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.70), which is only slightly increased by the addition of data on family history of NPC (AUC = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.72). With the addition of data on genetic variants, however, our model's discriminatory ability rises to 0.74 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.76). The improvements in NRI and IDI also suggest the potential usefulness of considering genetic variants when screening for NPC in endemic areas. If these findings are confirmed in larger cohort and population-based case-control studies, use of the new models to analyse data from NPC-endemic areas could well lead to earlier detection of NPC."

Subjects and methods: The study cohort comprised previously unscreened men who underwent sextant biopsy owing to elevated PSA (鈮3 ng/mL) in two different centres of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, Rotterdam (n = 2914) and G枚teborg (n = 740). A statistical model, based on kallikrein markers, was compared with one based on established clinical factors for the prediction of biopsy outcome.
Results: The clinical tests were found to be no better than blood markers, with an area under the curve in favour of the blood measurements of 0.766 vs. 0.763 in Rotterdam and 0.809 vs. 0.774 in G枚teborg. Adding digital rectal examination (DRE) or DRE plus transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) volume to the markers improved discrimination, although the increases were small. Results were similar for predicting high-grade cancer. There was a strong correlation between the blood measurements and TRUS-estimated prostate volume (Spearman's correlation 0.60 in Rotterdam and 0.57 in G枚teborg).
Conclusions: In previously unscreened men, each with indication for biopsy, a statistical model based on kallikrein levels was similar to a clinical model in predicting prostate cancer in a screening setting, outside the day-to-day clinical practice.

Objective: To determine whether long-term PSAV improves classification of PCa risk and mortality in the general population.
Design, setting, and participants: We studied 503 men aged 30-80 yr, with and without PCa, who had repeated PSA measurements over 20 yr and up to 28 yr before PCa diagnosis. These were selected from among 7455 men in the Copenhagen City Heart Study, a prospective, general population study with follow-up from 1981 through 2010. Results were subsequently applied to all 1 351 441 men aged 40-80 yr living in Denmark from 1997 through 2006.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: PCa risk and mortality were assessed using Cox regression. Improvement in risk classification was assessed using the net reclassification index (NRI).
Results: Age-adjusted hazard ratios for PCa risk and mortality were 2.7-5.3 and 2.3-3.4, respectively, for long-term PSAV when added to models already including baseline PSA values. For PCa risk and mortality, adding long-term PSAV to models already including baseline PSA values and age yielded continuous NRIs of 98-99% and 56-106%, respectively. Used on a nationwide scale (eg, for men aged 60-64 yr), long-term PSAV >0.35 versus 鈮 0.35 ng/ml per year appropriately reclassified 128 of 10 000 men with PCa and 8095 of 10 000 men with no PCa. Correspondingly, inappropriately reclassified were 49 of 10 000 men with PCa and 1658 of 10 000 men with no PCa.
Conclusions: Long-term PSAV in addition to baseline PSA value improves classification of PCa risk and mortality. Applying long-term PSAV nationwide, the ratio of appropriately to inappropriately classified men would typically be 5:1."

Modelling these environmental factors alongside genetic risk is critical in obtaining accurate estimates of disease risk and improving our understanding of behavioural modifications.
Methods: 14 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms identified though GWAS studies and reported on by the international consortium COGENT were used to model genetic disease risk at a population level. Six well validated environmental risks were selected for modelling together with the genetic risk factors (alcohol intake; smoking; exercise levels; BMI; fibre intake and consumption of red and processed meat). Through a simulation study using risk modelling software, we assessed the potential impact of behavioural modifications on disease risk.
Results: Modelling the genetic data alone leads to 24% of the population being classified as reduced risk; 60% average risk; 10% elevated risk and 6% high risk for colorectal cancer. Adding alcohol consumption to the model reduced the elevated and high risk categories to 9% and 5% respectively. The simulation study suggests that a substantial proportion of individuals could reduce their disease risk profile by altering their behaviour, including reclassification of over 62% of heavy drinkers.
Conclusion: Modelling lifestyle factors alongside genetic risk can provide useful strategies to select individuals for screening for colorectal cancer risk.

Stepwise logistic regression was used to determine the independent predictors of a positive initial biopsy. Age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume (PV), digital rectal examination (DRE) status, % free PSA and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) findings were included in the analysis. A nomogram model was developed that was based on these independent predictors to calculate the probability of a positive initial prostate biopsy. A receiver-operating characteristic curve was used to assess the accuracy of using the nomogram and PSA levels alone for predicting positive prostate biopsy. The rate for positive initial prostate biopsy was 41.7% (223/535). The independent variables used to predict a positive initial prostate biopsy were age, PSA, PV and DRE status. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for a positive initial prostate biopsy for PSA alone and the nomogram were 79.7% and 84.8%, respectively.

Purpose: To create a model that estimates the potential impact of pre-test risk prediction using clinical and genomic information on the reclassification of women with abnormal mammograms (BI-RADS3 and BI-RADS4 [Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System]) above and below the threshold for breast biopsy.
Methods: The current study modeled 1-year breast cancer risk in women with abnormal screening mammograms using existing data on breast cancer risk factors, 12 validated breast cancer single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and probability of cancer given the BI-RADS category. Examination was made of reclassification of women above and below biopsy thresholds of 1%, 2%, and 3% risk. The Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium data were collected from 1996 to 2002.

Although recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified multiple susceptibility loci for lung cancer, most of these variants have not been validated in a Chinese population. In this study, we investigated whether a genetic risk score combining multiple.
Methods: Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in previous GWA or large cohort studies were genotyped in 5068 Chinese case-control subjects. The genetic risk score (GRS) based on these SNPs was estimated by two approaches: a simple risk alleles count (cGRS) and a weighted (wGRS) method. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) in combination with the bootstrap resampling method was used to assess the predictive performance of the genetic risk score for lung cancer.
Results: Four independent SNPs (rs2736100, rs402710, rs4488809 and rs4083914), were found to be associated with a risk of lung cancer. The wGRS based on these four SNPs was a better predictor than cGRS. Using a liability threshold model, we estimated that these four SNPs accounted for only 4.02% of genetic variance in lung cancer. Smoking history contributed significantly to lung cancer (P < 0.001) risk [AUC = 0.619 (0.603-0.634)], and incorporated with wGRS gave an AUC value of 0.639 (0.621-0.652) after adjustment for over-fitting. This model shows promise for assessing lung cancer risk in a Chinese population.

Methods: We evaluated the performance of the BCRAT and IBIS models as currently applied in clinical settings for 10-year absolute risk of breast cancer, using prospective data from 1,857 women over a mean follow-up length of 8.1 years, of whom 83 developed cancer. This cohort spans the continuum of breast cancer risk, with some subjects at lower than average population risk. Therefore, the wide variation in individual risk makes it an interesting population to examine model performance across subgroups of women. For model calibration, we divided the cohort into quartiles of model-assigned risk and compared differences between assigned and observed risks using the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) chi-squared statistic. For model discrimination, we computed the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) and the case risk percentiles (CRPs).
Results: The 10-year risks assigned by BCRAT and IBIS differed (range of difference 0.001 to 79.5). The mean BCRAT- and IBIS-assigned risks of 3.18% and 5.49%, respectively, were lower than the cohort's 10-year cumulative probability of developing breast cancer (6.25%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.0 to 7.8%). Agreement between assigned and observed risks was better for IBIS (HL X4(2) = 7.2, P value 0.13) than BCRAT (HL X4(2) = 22.0, P value <0.001). The IBIS model also showed better discrimination (AUC = 69.5%, CI = 63.8% to 75.2%) than did the BCRAT model (AUC = 63.2%, CI = 57.6% to 68.9%). In almost all covariate-specific subgroups, BCRAT mean risks were significantly lower than the observed risks, while IBIS risks showed generally good agreement with observed risks, even in the subgroups of women considered at average risk (for example, no family history of breast cancer, BRCA1/2 mutation negative).

For model discrimination, we computed the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) and the case risk percentiles (CRPs).
Results: The 10-year risks assigned by BCRAT and IBIS differed (range of difference 0.001 to 79.5). The mean BCRAT- and IBIS-assigned risks of 3.18% and 5.49%, respectively, were lower than the cohort's 10-year cumulative probability of developing breast cancer (6.25%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.0 to 7.8%). Agreement between assigned and observed risks was better for IBIS (HL X4(2) = 7.2, P value 0.13) than BCRAT (HL X4(2) = 22.0, P value <0.001). The IBIS model also showed better discrimination (AUC = 69.5%, CI = 63.8% to 75.2%) than did the BCRAT model (AUC = 63.2%, CI = 57.6% to 68.9%). In almost all covariate-specific subgroups, BCRAT mean risks were significantly lower than the observed risks, while IBIS risks showed generally good agreement with observed risks, even in the subgroups of women considered at average risk (for example, no family history of breast cancer, BRCA1/2 mutation negative).
Conclusions: Models developed using extended family history and genetic data, such as the IBIS model, also perform well in women considered at average risk (for example, no family history of breast cancer, BRCA1/2 mutation negative). Extending such models to include additional nongenetic information may improve performance in women across the breast cancer risk continuum."

However, most patients with microscopic hematuria and many with gross hematuria are not appropriately referred to urologists. We hypothesized that in patients presenting with asymptomatic hematuria the risk of having bladder cancer can be predicted with high accuracy. Toward this end, we analyzed risk factors in patients with asymptomatic hematuria and developed a nomogram for the prediction of bladder cancer presence.
Methods: Data from 1,182 consecutive subjects without a history of bladder cancer undergoing initial evaluation for asymptomatic hematuria were collected at three centers. Clinical risk factors including age, gender, smoking status, and degree of hematuria were recorded. All subjects underwent standard workup including voided cytology, upper tract imaging, and cystourethroscopy. Factors associated with the presence of bladder cancer were evaluated by univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. The multivariable analysis was used to construct a nomogram. Internal validation was performed using 200 bootstrap samples.
Results: Of the 1,182 subjects who presented with asymptomatic hematuria, 245 (20.7 %) had bladder cancer. Increasing age (OR = 1.03, p < 0.0001), smoking history (OR = 3.72, p < 0.0001), gross hematuria (OR = 1.71, p = 0.002), and positive cytology (OR = 14.71, p < 0.0001) were independent predictors of bladder cancer presence. The multivariable model achieved 83.1 % accuracy for predicting the presence of bladder cancer.
Conclusions: Bladder cancer presence can be predicted with high accuracy in patients who present with asymptomatic hematuria. We developed a nomogram to help optimize referral patterns (i.e., timing and prioritization) of patients with asymptomatic hematuria."

We developed five simple risk prediction models based on clinically available data from the general population.
Methods: A prospective cohort of 428 584 subjects from a private health screening firm in Taiwan was divided into two subgroups-one with known HCV test results (n = 130 533 subjects) and the other without (n = 298 051 subjects). A total of 1668 incident hepatocellular carcinomas occurred during an average follow-up of 8.5 years. Model inputs included age, sex, health history-related variables; HBV or HCV infection-related variables; serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), as well as other variables of routine blood panels for liver function. Cox proportional hazards regression method was used to identify risk predictors of hepatocellular carcinoma. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess discriminatory accuracy of the models. Models were internally validated. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: Age, sex, health history, HBV and HCV status, and serum ALT, AST, AFP levels were statistically significant independent predictors of hepatocellular carcinoma risk (all P < .05). Use of serum transaminases only in a model showed a higher discrimination compared with HBV or HCV only (for transaminases, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.912, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.909 to 0.915; for HBV, AUC = 0.840, 95% CI = 0.833 to 0.848; and for HCV, AUC = 0.841, 95% CI = 0.834 to 0.847). Adding HBV and HCV data to the transaminase-only model improved the discrimination (AUC = 0.933, 95% CI = 0.929 to 0.949). Internal validation showed high discriminatory accuracy and calibration of these models.
Conclusion: Models with transaminase data were best able to predict hepatocellular carcinoma risk even among subjects with unknown or HBV- or HCV-negative infection status."

Our purpose was to assess the influence of this polymorphism on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence in two distinct longitudinal cohorts of patients with cirrhosis as well as its possible usefulness in HCC-risk model prediction.
Methods: PNPLA3 rs738409 genotypes were assessed in 279 patients with alcoholic- and 253 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis. These patients were followed-up and screened for the risk of HCC, and the influence of rs738409 on the occurrence of liver cancer was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method, then according to the multivariate Cox model.
Results: In patients with HCV-related cirrhosis, rs738409 genotypes did not influence the risk of HCC development (log-rank = 0.7) or death (log-rank = 0.2). Conversely, in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, the rs738409 (GG) genotype was an independent risk factor for HCC occurrence (HR = 1.72 [1.21-2.45], log-rank = 0.002) as well as older age, male gender, and higher BMI. Combining these features enabled HCC-risk stratification of this population into three groups with the 6-year cumulative incidence ranging from 3.4% (low risk, n = 58), 12.2% (intermediate risk, n = 163), and 51.7% (high risk, n = 58), respectively (HR = 4.3 [2.7-6.4]; log-rank <0.0001).
Conclusions: This study provides key data that affirm the influence of the rs738409 (GG) genotype on the occurrence of HCC in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Its combination with clinical features refines the selection of patients at higher risk of liver cancer development."

Genome-wide association studies have found unprecedented numbers of variants associated with complex human traits and diseases. However, these variants explain only a small proportion of genetic risk. Mounting evidence suggests that many traits, relevant to public health, are affected by large numbers of small-effect genes and that prediction of genetic risk to those traits and diseases could be improved by incorporating large numbers of markers into whole-genome prediction (WGP) models. We developed a WGP model incorporating thousands of markers for prediction of skin cancer risk in humans. We also considered other ways of incorporating genetic information into prediction models, such as family history or ancestry (using principal components, PCs, of informative markers). Prediction accuracy was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) estimated in a cross-validation. Incorporation of genetic information (i.e., familial relationships, PCs, or WGP) yielded a significant increase in prediction accuracy: from an AUC of 0.53 for a baseline model that accounted for nongenetic covariates to AUCs of 0.58 (pedigree), 0.62 (PCs), and 0.64 (WGP). In summary, prediction of skin cancer risk could be improved by considering genetic information and using a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a WGP model, which allows for the detection of patterns of genetic risk that are above and beyond those that can be captured using family history.

Using such models in clinical practice to guide the referral of patients for computed tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer depends on external validation and evidence of predicted clinical benefit.
Objective: To evaluate the discrimination of the Liverpool Lung Project (LLP) risk model and demonstrate its predicted benefit for stratifying patients for CT screening by using data from 3 independent studies from Europe and North America.
Design: Case-control and prospective cohort study.
Setting: Europe and North America.
Patients: Participants in the European Early Lung Cancer (EUELC) and Harvard case-control studies and the LLP population-based prospective cohort (LLPC) study.
Measurements: 5-year absolute risks for lung cancer predicted by the LLP model.
Results: The LLP risk model had good discrimination in both the Harvard (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.75 to 0.78]) and the LLPC (AUC, 0.82 [CI, 0.80 to 0.85]) studies and modest discrimination in the EUELC (AUC, 0.67 [CI, 0.64 to 0.69]) study. The decision utility analysis, which incorporates the harms and benefit of using a risk model to make clinical decisions, indicates that the LLP risk model performed better than smoking duration or family history alone in stratifying high-risk patients for lung cancer CT screening.
Limitations: The model cannot assess whether including other risk factors, such as lung function or genetic markers, would improve accuracy. Lack of information on asbestos exposure in the LLPC limited the ability to validate the complete LLP risk model.
Conclusion: Validation of the LLP risk model in 3 independent external data sets demonstrated good discrimination and evidence of predicted benefits for stratifying patients for lung cancer CT screening. Further studies are needed to prospectively evaluate model performance and evaluate the optimal population risk thresholds for initiating lung cancer screening."

Methods: Our prediction model was derived from data obtained on 17,654 Japanese aged 40 to 69 years who participated in health checkups (follow-up: 1993-2006). Cox proportional hazards regression was applied to obtain coefficients for each predictor.
Results: During follow-up, a total of 104 cases of HCC were newly diagnosed. After checking the model fit, we incorporated age, sex, alcohol consumption, body mass index, diabetes, coffee consumption, and hepatitis B and C virus infection into the prediction model. The model showed satisfactory discrimination (Harrell's c-index=0.94) and was well calibrated (the overall observed/expected ratio=1.03, 95% confidence interval=0.83-1.29). We also developed a simple risk scoring system. Those subjects with total scores of 17 or more under this system (score range: -1 to 19) had an estimated 10-year HCC risk of over 90%; those with 4 points or less had an estimated risk of less than 0.1%.

Aim: To produce a risk assessment model for PC based on familial background of related cancers.
Method: 976 859 independent index men aged 鈮30 in year 1998 and their family members in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database (FCD2010) were randomly divided into development (60%) and validation (40%) datasets (follow-up=10 years). The HR from Cox model was used to extrapolate risk scores. Results Specified scores were: for PC in situ at age <60 years in index man, 5; for PC at age <60 years in each first-degree relative (FDR), 15; for PC at age 鈮60 years in each FDR, 10; for PC at age <60 years in each second-degree relative, 5; for breast cancer in each FDR, 2; for oesophageal carcinoma in situ in index man, 2; and for oesophagus cancer in each FDR, 2. Based on the findings, if the milestone age for a PC screening programme was 60 years or more, the recommended starting age for the men with the score-group 6-10 would be 54 years; score-group 11-15, 52 years; score-group 16-20, 50 years; score-group 21-25, 44 years; and for the score-group 26+ it should start before age 40. The concordance index in development and validation sets was 0.885 (95% CI 0.883 to 0.888). No significant difference was found between curves from development and validation datasets (internally validated using twofold validation and bootstrapping).

In this study, we propose to use the graded response model (GRM), which is based on the item response theory, for estimating the individual risk that is associated with a set of SNPs. We compare the GRM with a recently proposed risk prediction model called cumulative relative risk (CRR). Thirty-three prostate cancer risk-associated SNPs were originally discovered in GWAS by December 2009. These SNPs were used to evaluate the performance of GRM and CRR for predicting prostate cancer risk in three GWAS populations, including populations from Sweden, Johns Hopkins Hospital, and the National Cancer Institute Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility study.

Methods: We studied 6 cohorts (5 European and 1 US) with a total of 15,300 men, all biopsied and with pre-biopsy TRUS measurements of prostate volume. Volume was categorized into 3 categories (25, 40, and 60 cc), to reflect use of digital rectal examination (DRE) for volume assessment. Risks of prostate cancer were calculated according to a ERSPC DRE-based RC (including PSA, DRE, prior biopsy, and prostate volume) and a PSA + DRE model (including PSA, DRE, and prior biopsy).

Risk predictions were evaluated with respect to calibration (graphically), discrimination (AUC curve), and clinical usefulness (net benefit, graphically assessed in decision curves).
Results: The AUCs of the ERSPC DRE-based RC ranged from 0.61 to 0.77 and were substantially larger than the AUCs of a model based on only PSA + DRE (ranging from 0.56 to 0.72) in each of the 6 cohorts. The ERSPC DRE-based RC provided net benefit over performing a prostate biopsy on the basis of PSA and DRE outcome in five of the six cohorts.
Conclusions: Identifying men at increased risk for having a biopsy detectable prostate cancer should consider multiple factors, including an estimate of prostate volume."

We compared the relative risks and calibration of BCRAT risk projections for 6,353 Hispanic to 128,976 NHW postmenopausal participants aged 50 and older in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). Calibration was assessed by the ratio of the number of breast cancers observed with that expected by the BCRAT (O/E). We re-evaluated calibration for an updated BCRAT that combined BCRAT relative risks with 1993-2007 breast cancer incidence that is contemporaneous with the WHI. Cox regression was used to estimate relative risks. Discriminatory accuracy was assessed using the concordance statistic (AUC). In the WHI Main Study, the BCRAT underestimated the number of breast cancers by 18% in both Hispanics (O/E = 1.18, P = 0.06) and NHWs (O/E = 1.18, P < 0.001). Updating the BCRAT improved calibration for Hispanic women (O/E = 1.08, P = 0.4) and NHW women (O/E = 0.98, P = 0.2). For Hispanic women, relative risks for number of breast biopsies (1.71 vs. 1.27, P = 0.03) and age at first birth (0.97 vs. 1.24, P = 0.02) differed between the WHI and BCRAT. The AUC was higher for Hispanic women than NHW women (0.63 vs. 0.58, P = 0.03). Updating the BCRAT with contemporaneous breast cancer incidence rates improved calibration in the WHI. The modest discriminatory accuracy of the BCRAT for Hispanic women might improve by using risk factor relative risks specific to Hispanic women."

Objective: Develop and validate an RC based on digital rectal examination (DRE) that circumvents the need for TRUS but still includes information on PV.
Design, setting, and participants: For development of the DRE-based RC, we studied the original ERSPC Rotterdam RC population including 3624 men (885 PCa cases) and 2896 men (547 PCa cases) detected at first and repeat screening 4 yr later, respectively. A validation cohort consisted of 322 men, screened in 2010-2011 as participants in ERSPC Rotterdam.
Measurements: Data on TRUS-assessed PV in the development cohorts were re-coded into three categories (25, 40, and 60 cm3) to assess the loss of information by categorization of volume information. New RCs including PSA, DRE, and PV categories (DRE-based RC) were developed for men with and without a previous negative biopsy to predict overall and clinically significant PCa (high-grade [HG] PCa) defined as T stage>T2b and/or Gleason score鈮7. Predictive accuracy was quantified by the area under the receiver operating curve. We compared performance with the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) RC in the validation study.
Results and limitations: Areas under the curve (AUC) of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) alone, PSA and DRE, the DRE-based RC, and the original ERSPC RC to predict PCa at initial biopsy were 0.69, 0.73, 0.77, and 0.79, respectively. The corresponding AUCs for predicting HG PCa were higher (0.74, 0.82, 0.85, and 0.86). Similar results were seen in men previously biopsied and in the validation cohort. The DRE-based RC outperformed the PCPT RC (AUC 0.69 vs 0.59; p=0.0001) and a model based on PSA and DRE only (AUC 0.69 vs 0.63; p=0.0075) in the relatively small validation cohort.

Objective: Evaluate previously identified SNPs for association with prostate cancer and accuracy in predicting prostate cancer in a large prospective population-based cohort of unscreened men.
Design, setting, and participants: This study used a nested case-control design based on the Malm枚 Diet and Cancer cohort with 943 men diagnosed with prostate cancer and 2829 matched controls. Blood samples were collected between 1991 and 1996, and follow-up lasted through 2005.
Measurements: We genotyped 50 SNPs, analyzed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in blood from baseline, and tested for association with prostate cancer using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. We further developed a predictive model using SNPs nominally significant in univariate analysis and determined its accuracy to predict prostate cancer.
Results and limitations: Eighteen SNPs at 10 independent loci were associated with prostate cancer. Four independent SNPs at four independent loci remained significant after multiple test correction (p<0.001). Seven SNPs at five independent loci were associated with advanced prostate cancer defined as clinical stage鈮T3 or evidence of metastasis at diagnosis. Four independent SNPs were associated with advanced or aggressive cancer defined as stage鈮T3, metastasis, Gleason score鈮8, or World Health Organization grade 3 at diagnosis. Prostate cancer risk prediction with SNPs alone was less accurate than with PSA at baseline (area under the curve of 0.57 vs 0.79), with no benefit from combining SNPs with PSA. This study is limited by our reliance on clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer; there are likely undiagnosed cases among our control group.
Conclusions: Only a few previously reported SNPs were associated with prostate cancer risk in the large prospective Diet and Cancer cohort in Malm枚, Sweden. SNPs were less useful in predicting prostate cancer risk than PSA at baseline."

We aimed to build a simple model for the identification of patients at high risk of developing HCC.
Methods: Chronic hepatitis C patients followed for at least 5 years (n=1003) were analyzed by data mining to build a predictive model for HCC development. The model was externally validated using a cohort of 1072 patients (472 with sustained virological response (SVR) and 600 with nonSVR to PEG-interferon plus ribavirin therapy).
Results: On the basis of factors such as age, platelet, albumin, and aspartate aminotransferase, the HCC risk prediction model identified subgroups with high-, intermediate-, and low-risk of HCC with a 5-year HCC development rate of 20.9%, 6.3-7.3%, and 0-1.5%, respectively. The reproducibility of the model was confirmed through external validation (r(2)=0.981). The 10-year HCC development rate was also significantly higher in the high-and intermediate-risk group than in the low-risk group (24.5% vs. 4.8%; p<0.0001). In the high-and intermediate-risk group, the incidence of HCC development was significantly reduced in patients with SVR compared to those with nonSVR (5-year rate, 9.5% vs. 4.5%; p=0.040).
Conclusions: The HCC risk prediction model uses simple and readily available factors and identifies patients at a high risk of HCC development. The model allows physicians to identify patients requiring HCC surveillance and those who benefit from IFN therapy to prevent HCC."

So far, few publications have shown that a prediction model influences the behaviour of both physicians and patients. To our knowledge, it was unknown whether urologists and patients are compliant with the recommendations of a prostate cancer risk calculator and their reasons for non-compliance. Recommendations of the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer risk calculator (ERSPC RC) about the need of a prostate biopsy were followed in most patients. In most cases of non-compliance with 'no biopsy' recommendations, a PSA level 鈮 3 ng/mL was decisive to opt for biopsy. Before implementation of the ERSPC RC in urological practices at a large scale, it is important to obtain insight into the use of guidelines that might counteract the adoption of the use of the RC as a result of opposing recommendations.
Objectives: To assess both urologist and patient compliance with a 'no biopsy' or 'biopsy' recommendation of the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) Risk Calculator (RC), as well as their reasons for non-compliance. To assess determinants of patient compliance.
Patients and methods: The ERSPC RC calculates the probability on a positive sextant prostate biopsy (P(posb) ) using serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, outcomes of digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasonography, and ultrasonographically assessed prostate volume. A biopsy was recommended if P(posb) 鈮20%. Between 2008 and 2011, eight urologists from five Dutch hospitals included 443 patients (aged 55-75 years) after a PSA test with no previous biopsy. Urologists calculated the P(posb) using the RC in the presence of patients and completed a questionnaire about compliance. Patients completed a questionnaire about prostate cancer knowledge, attitude towards prostate biopsy, self-rated health (12-Item Short Form Health Survey), anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory-6, Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer) and decision-making measures (Decisional Conflict Scale).
Results: Both urologists and patients complied with the RC recommendation in 368 of 443 (83%) cases. If a biopsy was recommended, almost all patients (96%; 257/269) complied, although 63 of the 174 (36%) patients were biopsied against the recommendation of the RC. Compliers with a 'no biopsy' recommendation had a lower mean P(posb) than non-compliers (9% vs 14%; P < 0.001). Urologists opted for biopsies against the recommendations of the RC because of an elevated PSA level (鈮 3 ng/mL) (78%; 49/63) and patients because they wanted certainty (60%; 38/63).
Conclusions: Recommendations of the ERSPC RC on prostate biopsy were followed in most patients. The RC hence may be a promising tool for supporting clinical decision-making."

Based on published studies of 26 SNPs that are currently known to be associated with prostate cancer, we have extended our model to incorporate these SNPs by decomposing the polygenic component into two parts: a polygenic component due to the known susceptibility SNPs, , and the residual polygenic component due to the postulated but as yet unknown genetic variants, .

Methods: Using data from a case-control study of women in Italy (2569 case patients and 2588 control subjects studied from June 1, 1991, to April 1, 1994) and incidence and mortality data from the Florence Registries, we developed a model to predict the absolute risk of breast cancer that included five non-modifiable risk factors (reproductive characteristics, education, occupational activity, family history, and biopsy history) and three modifiable risk factors (alcohol consumption, leisure physical activity, and body mass index). The model was validated using independent data, and the percent risk reduction was calculated in high-risk subgroups identified by use of the Lorenz curve.
Results: The model was reasonably well calibrated (ratio of expected to observed cancers = 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.96 to 1.26), but the discriminatory accuracy was modest. The absolute risk reduction from exposure modifications was nearly proportional to the risk before modifying the risk factors and increased with age and risk projection time span. Mean 20-year reductions in absolute risk among women aged 65 years were 1.6% (95% CI = 0.9% to 2.3%) in the entire population, 3.2% (95% CI = 1.8% to 4.8%) among women with a positive family history of breast cancer, and 4.1% (95% CI = 2.5% to 6.8%) among women who accounted for the highest 10% of the total population risk, as determined from the Lorenz curve.
Conclusions: These data give perspective on the potential reductions in absolute breast cancer risk from preventative strategies based on lifestyle changes. Our methods are also useful for calculating sample sizes required for trials to test lifestyle interventions."

The approach has been based on the contribution of counting multiple alleles associated with disease across independent loci, without requiring compelling evidence that every locus had already achieved definitive genome-wide statistical significance. Whether PRS assist in the prediction of risk of common cancers is unknown. We built PRS from lists of genetic markers prioritized by their association with breast cancer (BCa) or prostate cancer (PCa) in a training data set and evaluated whether these scores could improve current genetic prediction of these specific cancers in independent test samples. We used genome-wide association data on 1,145 BCa cases and 1,142 controls from the Nurses' Health Study and 1,164 PCa cases and 1,113 controls from the Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Ten-fold cross validation was used to build and evaluate PRS with 10 to 60,000 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For both BCa and PCa, the models that included only published risk alleles maximized the cross-validation estimate of the area under the ROC curve (0.53 for breast and 0.57 for prostate).

Methods: Total PSA (tPSA) and free PSA were measured in 780 biopsy-referred men with 5 different assays. These data, together with other clinical parameters, were applied to 5 published nomograms that are used for PCa detection. Discrimination and calibration criteria were used to characterize the accuracy of the nomogram models under these conditions.
Results: PCa was found in 455 men (58.3%), and 325 men had no evidence of malignancy. Median tPSA concentrations ranged from 5.5 渭g/L to 7.04 渭g/L, whereas the median percentage of free PSA ranged from 10.6% to 16.4%. Both the calibration and discrimination of the nomograms varied significantly across different types of PSA assays. Median PCa probabilities, which indicate PCa risk, ranged from 0.59 to 0.76 when different PSA assays were used within the same nomogram. On the other hand, various nomograms produced different PCa probabilities when the same PSA assay was used. Although the ROC curves had comparable areas under the ROC curve, considerable differences were observed among the 5 assays when the sensitivities and specificities at various PCa probability cutoffs were analyzed.
Conclusions: The accuracy of the PCa probabilities predicted according to different nomograms is limited by the lack of agreement between the different PSA assays.

Objectives: We aimed to design a population-specific risk assessment tool to improve on the use of intuition alone for assignment of surveillance strategies for high-risk individuals and help communicate risk more accurately and effectively to patients.
Methods: Methods used in the development of breast cancer risk models were adopted. Data from a large meta-analysis was used to determine risk estimates. Attributable risk was calculated for each risk factor using data from the Victorian Melanoma Service. Local prevalence data from state cancer registries was incorporated to estimate 5-year risk of melanoma.
Results: Independent risk factors identified were common naevi, atypical naevi, hair colour, freckles, family history of melanoma and personal history of non-melanoma skin cancer. Personal history of melanoma was the strongest risk factor for developing another (relative risk 7.28, 7.24). Absolute risk for individuals varies greatly with age, risk factor profiles and proximity to the equator.
Conclusion: We have developed a melanoma risk assessment tool based on the best available information (http://www.victorianmelanomaservice.org/calculator). The tool is easily modified as new information becomes available."

However, the absolute risk estimates for Asian and Pacific Islander American (APA) women are based on data from white women. We developed a model for projecting absolute invasive breast cancer risk in APA women and compared its projections to those from BCRAT.
Methods: Data from 589 women with breast cancer (case patients) and 952 women without breast cancer (control subjects) in the Asian American Breast Cancer Study were used to compute relative and attributable risks based on the age at menarche, number of affected mothers, sisters, and daughters, and number of previous benign biopsies. Absolute risks were obtained by combining this information with ethnicity-specific data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and with US ethnicity-specific mortality data to create the Asian American Breast Cancer Study model (AABCS model). Independent data from APA women in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) were used to check the calibration and discriminatory accuracy of the AABCS model.
Results: The AABCS model estimated absolute risk separately for Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Other Pacific Islander, and Other Asian women. Relative and attributable risks for APA women were comparable to those in BCRAT, but the AABCS model usually estimated lower-risk projections than BCRAT in Chinese and Filipino, but not in Hawaiian women, and not in every age and ethnic subgroup. The AABCS model underestimated absolute risk by 17% (95% confidence interval = 1% to 38%) in independent data from WHI, but APA women in the WHI had incidence rates approximately 18% higher than those estimated from the SEER program.
Conclusions: The AABCS model was calibrated to ethnicity-specific incidence rates from the SEER program for projecting absolute invasive breast cancer risk and is preferable to BCRAT for counseling APA women."

The purpose of this study was to preliminarily assess the performance of this system in classifying younger women into two groups, those ultimately recommended for biopsy during imaging-based diagnostic workups that followed screening and those rated as negative during mammography.
Methods: A seven probe-based REIS system was designed, assembled, and is currently being tested in the breast imaging facility. During an examination, contact is made with the nipple and six concentric points on the breast skin. For each measurement channel between the center probe and one of the six external probes, a set of electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) signal sweeps is performed and signal outputs ranging from 200 to 800 kHz at 5 kHz interval are recorded. An initial subset of 174 examinations from an ongoing prospective clinical study was selected for this preliminary analysis. An initial set of 35 features, 33 of which represented the corresponding EIS signal differences between the left and right breasts, was established. A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) classifier was developed to differentiate between ""positive"" (biopsy recommended) cases and ""negative"" (nonbiopsy) cases. Selecting an optimal feature set was performed using genetic algorithms with an area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as the fitness criterion.
Results: The recorded EIS signal sweeps showed that, in general, negative (nonbiopsy) examinations have a higher level of electrical impedance symmetry between the two breasts than positive (biopsy) examinations. Fourteen features were selected by genetic algorithm and used in the optimized GMM classifier. Using a leave-one-case-out test, the GMM classifier yielded a performance level of AUC = 0.78, which compared favorably to other three widely used classifiers including support vector machine, classification tree, and linear discriminant analysis. These results also suggest that the REIS signal based GMM classifier could be used as a prescreening tool to correctly identify a fraction of younger women at higher risk of developing breast cancer (i.e., 47% sensitivity at 90% specificity).
Conclusions: The study confirms that asymmetry in electrical impedance characteristics between two breasts provides valuable information regarding the presence of a developing breast abnormality; hence, REIS data may be useful in classifying younger women into two groups of ""average"" and ""significantly higher than average"" risk of having or developing a breast abnormality that would ultimately result in a later imaging-based recommendation for biopsy."

This study aimed to develop and validate a simple scoring system to predict HCC risk in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Methods: The development cohort consisted of 3584 patients without cirrhosis from the community-based Taiwanese REVEAL-HBV study (of whom 131 developed HCC during follow-up), and a validation cohort of 1505 patients from three hospitals in Hong Kong and South Korea (of whom 111 developed HCC during follow-up). We used Cox multivariate proportional hazards model to predict risk of HCC at 3, 5, and 10 years. Variables included in the risk score were sex, age, serum alanine aminotransferase concentration, HBeAg status, and serum HBV DNA level. We calculated the area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) and calibration of predicted and observed HCC risk.
Findings: A 17-point risk score was developed, with HCC risk ranging from 0路0% to 23路6% at 3 years, 0路0% to 47路4% at 5 years, and 0路0% to 81路6% at 10 years for patients with the lowest and highest HCC risk, respectively. AUROCs to predict risk were 0路811 (95% CI 0路790-0路831) at 3 years, 0路796 (0路775-0路816) at 5 years, and 0路769 (0路747-0路790) at 10 years in the validation cohort, and 0路902 (0路884-0路918), 0路783 (0路759-0路806), and 0路806 (0路783-0路828), respectively, after exclusion of 277 patients in the validation cohort with cirrhosis.

Patients and methods: This prospective study of consecutive postmenopausal women presenting with vaginal bleeding was conducted at a gynecological oncology center in the United Kingdom for a 46-month period. All women underwent transvaginal ultrasound scanning as the initial investigation tool to evaluate the endometrium. Women found to have an endometrial thickness 5 mm or more had endometrial sampling performed.
Results: Of a total of 3548 women presenting with vaginal bleeding during the study period, 201 (6%) women had a diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma. An investigator-led best model selection approach used to select the best predictors of cancer in the multiple logistic regression model showed that patient's age (odds ratio [OR], 1.06), body mass index (OR, 1.07), recurrent episodes of bleeding (OR, 3.64), and a history of diabetes (OR, 1.48) increased the risk of endometrial malignancy when corrected for other characteristics. The mentioned clinical variables satisfied the criteria for inclusion in our predictive model called FAD 31 (F for the frequency of bleeding episodes, A for the age of the patient, D for diabetes, and the number 31 represents the BMI cut-off value). The total score for the model varies from 0 to 8. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the developed model was 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.77).
Discussion: We have developed a simple model based on patients' clinical characteristics in estimating the risk of endometrial cancer for postmenopausal women presenting with vaginal bleeding. The model shows reasonable discriminatory ability for women with cancer and without, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.73. This will allow clinicians to individualize the diagnostic pathway for women with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding."

Methods: Women from the Raloxifene Use for The Heart trial (N = 10,048), which consisted of postmenopausal women with or at high risk for coronary artery disease, were included in this post hoc analysis. The breast cancer risk score at baseline was calculated using the National Cancer Institute's Breast Cancer Risk Assessment tool. The positive predictive value of family history as a predictor of risk was determined for several risk thresholds.
Results: Almost all (99.6%) women with a family history of breast cancer are found to be at high risk using the National Cancer Institute's accepted cutoff point of at least 1.66%, and almost 98% of women with a family history of breast cancer belong to the high-risk group when the cutoff point for risk score is 2%.

The post-menopausal group enclosed 13 benign cases (11 of which were classified by ROMA as low-risk with a specificity of 84.6%; 95% CI: 54.6%-98.0%), and 40 EOC (33 of which were classified by ROMA as high-risk with a sensitivity of 82.5%; 95% CI: 67.2%-92.7%). In the pre-menopausal group, the AUC was 0.64 (p=0.12, 95% CI: 0.44-0.83) for CA125, 0.77 (p=0.003, 95% CI: 0.62-0.92) for HE4 and 0.77 (p=0.002, 95% CI: 0.63-0.92) for ROMA. In the post-menopausal group, the AUC was 0.84 (p=0.0003, 95% CI: 0.73-0.94) for CA125, 0.94 (p<0.0001, 95% CI: 0.88-0.99) for HE4 and 0.92 (p<0.0001, 95% CI: 0.85-0.99) for ROMA.
Conclusions: The ROMA is a simple scoring system which shows excellent diagnostic performance for the detection of EOC in post-menopausal women, but not in pre-menopausal women. Moreover, the dual marker combination of HE4 and CA125 (ROMA) does not show better performance than HE4 alone."

Data were collected from 602 Koreans who underwent initial prostate biopsies due to an increased level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a palpable nodule upon digital rectal examination (DRE), or a hypoechoic lesion upon transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). The clinical and laboratory variables were analyzed by simple and multiple logistic regression analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was computed to compare its performance to PSA testing alone. Prostate cancer was detected in 172 (28.6%) men. Independent predictors included age, DRE findings, PSA level, and prostate transitional zone volume. We developed the KPCRC using these variables. The AUC for the selected model was 0.91, and that of PSA testing alone was 0.83 (P < 0.001). The AUC for the selected model with an additional dataset was 0.79, and that of PSA testing alone was 0.73 (P = 0.004). The calculator is available on the website: http://pcrc.korea.ac.kr.

Objective: To assess the external validity of the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) risk calculator (www.prostatecancer-riskcalculator.com) for the probability of having a positive prostate biopsy (P(posb)).
Design, setting and participants: The ERSPC risk calculator was based on data of the initial screening round of the ERSPC section Rotterdam and validated in 1825 and 531 men biopsied at the initial screening round in the Finnish and Swedish sections of the ERSPC respectively. P(posb) was calculated using serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), outcome of digital rectal examination (DRE), transrectal ultrasound and ultrasound assessed prostate volume.
Measurements: The external validity was assessed for the presence of cancer at biopsy by calibration (agreement between observed and predicted outcomes), discrimination (separation of those with and without cancer), and decision curves (for clinical usefulness).
Results and limitations: Prostate cancer was detected in 469 men (26%) of the Finnish cohort and in 124 men (23%) of the Swedish cohort. Systematic miscalibration was present in both cohorts (mean predicted probability 34% versus 26% observed, and 29% versus 23% observed, both p<0.001). The areas under the curves were 0.76 and 0.78, and substantially lower for the model with PSA only (0.64 and 0.68 respectively). The model proved clinically useful for any decision threshold compared with a model with PSA only, PSA and DRE, or biopsying all men. A limitation is that the model is based on sextant biopsies results.
Conclusions: The ERSPC risk calculator discriminated well between those with and without prostate cancer among initially screened men, but overestimated the risk of a positive biopsy. Further research is necessary to assess the performance and applicability of the ERSPC risk calculator when a clinical setting is considered rather than a screening setting."

The TSCE model is traditionally fitted to prospective cohort data. Here, the authors describe a new method that allows for the reconstruction of cohort data from the combination of risk factor data obtained from a case-control study, and tabled incidence/mortality rate data, and discuss alternative approaches. The method is applied to fit a TSCE model based on smoking.

Our aim was to develop a prediction rule to stratify risk for pancreatic cancer in chronic pancreatitis patients with focal pancreatic mass lesions with prior negative EUS-FNA cytology.
Material and methods: A total of 138 eligible consecutive patients were identified from three hospitals between January 2000 and May 2008. A final diagnosis of pancreatic mass lesions was confirmed histologically or verified by a follow-up of at least 12 months. A prediction rule was developed from a logistic regression model by using a regression coefficient-based scoring method, and then internally validated by using bootstrapping.
Results: The rate of pancreatic cancer in the cohort was 18.1%. The prediction rule, which was scored from 0 to 10 points, comprised five variables: sex, mass location, mass number, direct bilirubin, and CA 19-9. Among the 87.7% of patients with low-risk scores (鈮 3), the risk of pancreatic cancer was 13.2%; by comparison, this risk was 52.9% (p < 0.001) among the 12.3% of patients with high-risk scores (> 3). If further invasive tests were used for patients with high risk, 36% of patients with pancreatic cancer would not be missed. The prediction rule had good discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.72) and calibration (p = 0.96).
Conclusions: The prediction rule can provide available risk stratification for pancreatic cancer in chronic pancreatitis patients with focal mass lesions with prior negative EUS-FNA cytology. Application of risk stratification may improve clinical decision making."

We develop and validate polytomous models (models that predict more than two events) to diagnose ovarian tumors as benign, borderline, primary invasive or metastatic invasive. The main focus is on how different types of models perform and compare.
Methods: A multi-center dataset containing 1066 women was used for model development and internal validation, whilst another multi-center dataset of 1938 women was used for temporal and external validation. Models were based on standard logistic regression and on penalized kernel-based algorithms (least squares support vector machines and kernel logistic regression). We used true polytomous models as well as combinations of dichotomous models based on the 'pairwise coupling' technique to produce polytomous risk estimates. Careful variable selection was performed, based largely on cross-validated c-index estimates. Model performance was assessed with the dichotomous c-index (i.e. the area under the ROC curve) and a polytomous extension, and with calibration graphs.
Results: For all models, between 9 and 11 predictors were selected. Internal validation was successful with polytomous c-indexes between 0.64 and 0.69. For the best model dichotomous c-indexes were between 0.73 (primary invasive vs metastatic) and 0.96 (borderline vs metastatic). On temporal and external validation, overall discrimination performance was good with polytomous c-indexes between 0.57 and 0.64. However, discrimination between primary and metastatic invasive tumors decreased to near random levels. Standard logistic regression performed well in comparison with advanced algorithms, and combining dichotomous models performed well in comparison with true polytomous models. The best model was a combination of dichotomous logistic regression models. This model is available online.
Conclusions: We have developed models that successfully discriminate between benign, borderline, and invasive ovarian tumors. Methodologically, the combination of dichotomous models was an interesting approach to tackle the polytomous problem. Standard logistic regression models were not outperformed by regularized kernel-based alternatives, a finding to which the careful variable selection procedure will have contributed.

Gail, Claus, and IBIS models were used to estimate absolute breast cancer risks. Subjects were then genotyped at 15 independent risk loci. Published per-allele and genotype-specific odds ratios were used to calculate the composite cumulative genomic risk (CGR) for each subject. Affected age- and ethnicity-matched BRCA mutation-negative women were also genotyped as a comparison group for the calculation of discriminatory accuracy. The CGR was used to adjust absolute breast cancer risks calculated by Gail, Claus and IBIS models to determine the proportion of subjects whose recommendations for chemoprevention or MRI screening might be altered (reclassified) by such adjustment. Mean lifetime breast cancer risks calculated using the Gail, Claus, and IBIS models were 19.4, 13.0, and 17.7%, respectively. CGR did not correlate with breast cancer risk as calculated using any model. CGR was significantly higher in affected women (mean 3.35 vs. 3.12, P = 0.009). The discriminatory accuracy of the CGR alone was 0.55 (SE 0.019; P = 0.006). CGR adjustment of model-derived absolute risk estimates would have altered clinical recommendations for chemoprevention in 11-19% of subjects and for MRI screening in 8-32%.

In recent years, a substantial number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with breast cancer risk have been identified. However, it remains unclear how to effectively integrate clinical and genetic risk factors for risk assessment.
Methods: Seven SNPs associated with breast cancer risk were selected from the literature and genotyped in white non-Hispanic women in a nested case-control cohort of 1664 case patients and 1636 control subjects within the Women's Health Initiative Clinical Trial. SNP risk scores were computed based on previously published odds ratios assuming a multiplicative model. Combined risk scores were calculated by multiplying Gail risk estimates by the SNP risk scores. The independence of Gail risk and SNP risk was evaluated by logistic regression. Calibration of relative risks was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The performance of the combined risk scores was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves. The net reclassification improvement (NRI) was used to assess improvement in classification of women into low (<1.5%), intermediate (1.5%-2%), and high (>2%) categories of 5-year risk. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided.
Results: The SNP risk score was nearly independent of Gail risk. There was good agreement between predicted and observed SNP relative risks. In the analysis for receiver operating characteristic curves, the combined risk score was more discriminating, with area under the curve of 0.594 compared with area under the curve of 0.557 for Gail risk alone (P < .001). Classification also improved for 5.6% of case patients and 2.9% of control subjects, showing an NRI value of 0.085 (P = 1.0 脳 10鈦烩伒). Focusing on women with intermediate Gail risk resulted in an improved NRI of 0.195 (P = 8.6 脳 10鈦烩伒).

Objective: To compare the performance of the two available risk estimators incorporating PCA3 in the detection of PCa in the ""grey area"" of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <10 ng/ml: the updated Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) calculator and Chun's nomogram.
Design, setting, and participants: Two hundred eighteen patients presenting with an abnormal PSA (excluding those with PSA >10 ng/ml) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination were prospectively enrolled in a multicentre Italian study between October 2008 and October 2009. All patients underwent 鈮12-core prostate biopsy.
Measurements: PCA3 scores were assessed using the Progensa assay (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA, USA). Comparisons between the two models were performed using tests of accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC-ROC]), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. Biopsy predictors were identified by univariable and multivariable logistic regression. In addition, performance of PCA3 was analysed through AUC-ROC and predictive values.
Results and limitations: PCa was detected in 73 patients (33.5%). Among predictors included in the models, only PCA3, PSA, and prostate volume retained significant predictive value. AUC-ROC was higher for the updated PCPT calculator compared to Chun's nomogram (79.6% vs 71.5%; p=0.043); however, Chun's nomogram displayed better overall calibration and a higher net benefit on decision curve analysis. Using a probability threshold of 25%, no high-grade cancers would be missed; the PCPT calculator would save 11% of biopsies, missing no cancer, whereas Chun's nomogram would save 22% of avoidable biopsies, although missing 4.1% non-high-grade cancers. The small number of patients may account for the lack of statistical significance in the predictive value of individual variables or model comparison.

AUC-ROC was higher for the updated PCPT calculator compared to Chun's nomogram (79.6% vs 71.5%; p=0.043); however, Chun's nomogram displayed better overall calibration and a higher net benefit on decision curve analysis. Using a probability threshold of 25%, no high-grade cancers would be missed; the PCPT calculator would save 11% of biopsies, missing no cancer, whereas Chun's nomogram would save 22% of avoidable biopsies, although missing 4.1% non-high-grade cancers. The small number of patients may account for the lack of statistical significance in the predictive value of individual variables or model comparison.
Conclusions: Both Chun's nomogram and the PCPT calculator, by incorporating PCA3, can assist in the decision to biopsy by assignment of an individual risk of PCa, specifically in the PSA levels <10 ng/ml."

There have been many studies detailing the relative risks of breast cancer based on different factors and applications to calculate the breast cancer risk, but none implemented in a way to show lifetime risk. This paper presents an on-line tool (called Breast Alert) to calculate the lifetime breast cancer risk for women using a proposed model. With Breast Alert, physicians can make a quick screening for women when they consult. It is easy to use and intuitive. In a few minutes, physicians can have a lifetime breast cancer risk. This tool does not replace tests like self-examination, breast screening or detection by other options, but allows for the proper precautions to be taken and calls attention to the expected lifetime risk. Nowadays, 300 women (between 20 and 75 years old) from different countries have used the system and most of them (80%) have a higher than normal chance of contracting breast cancer. With these results, it is important to alert of the importance to make an early prevention of breast cancer in different women groups."

The goal of this prospective analysis was to see whether these models perform differently according to the prevalence of malignancy and whether the cut-off levels of risk assessment for malignancy by the models require modification in different centers.
Methods: Centers were categorized into those with a prevalence of malignancy below 15%, between 15 and 30% and above 30%. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristics curves (AUC) were compared using bootstrapping. The optimal cut-off level of risk assessment for malignancy was chosen per center, corresponding to the highest sensitivity level possible while still keeping a good specificity.
Results: Both models performed better in centers with a lower prevalence of malignant cases. The AUCs of the two models for centers with fewer than 15% malignant cases were 0.97 and 0.95, those of centers with 15-30% malignancy were 0.95 and 0.93 and those of centers with more than 30% malignant cases were 0.94 and 0.92. This decrease in performance was due mainly to the decrease in specificity from over 90 to around 76%. In the centers with a higher percentage of malignant cases, a sensitivity of at least 90% with a good specificity could not be obtained by choosing a different cut-off level.
Conclusions: Overall the models performed well in all centers. The performance of the logistic regression models worsened with increasing prevalence of malignancy, due to a case mix with more borderline and complex benign masses seen in those centers. Because the cut-off of 0.10 is optimal for all three types of center, it seems reasonable to use this cut-off for both models in all centers."

Information on previous benign breast disease biopsies has been incorporated into breast cancer risk prediction models; however, the type of histologic lesion has not been taken into account. Given the substantial heterogeneity in breast cancer risk dependent on the type of benign lesion, the authors evaluated whether incorporating this level of detail would improve the discriminatory power of risk classification models.
Methods: By using data from the Nurses' Health Study, a breast cancer nested case-control study (240 cases; 1036 controls), the authors determined predictors of categories of BBD lesions and developed imputation models. The type of BBD, imputed for each cohort member who reported a diagnosis, was added to a modified version of the Rosner-Colditz breast cancer risk prediction model.
Results: Compared with the model that included only previous BBD (yes/no), the model that included categories of BBD was significantly improved (P<.0001). Overall, including the category of BBD increased the concordance statistic from 0.628 to 0.635. By using risk reclassification, inclusion of the type of BBD resulted in a 17% increase in incidence per increase of 1 risk decile, holding the model without BBD type risk decile constant.
Conclusions: Although the current data suggested that the inclusion of BBD category may improve breast cancer risk classification, the clinical utility of such a model will depend on the consistency of histologic classification of benign breast disease lesions."

Objective: To evaluate the performance of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) and European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) risk calculators in detecting PCa in a contemporary screened cohort.
Design, setting, and participants: We analyzed prebiopsy characteristics of 525 consecutive screened patients submitted to biopsy, as required by the risk calculators, in one European center between 2006 and 2007.
Measurements: Comparisons were done using tests of accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC-ROC]), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. Biopsy predictors were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression.
Results and limitations: PCa was detected in 35.2% of the subjects. Among predictors included in the calculators, the logarithmic transformations of prostate volume and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination, previous biopsy status, and age were significantly associated with PCa; transrectal ultrasound abnormalities and family history were not. AUC-ROC for the ERSPC calculator was significantly higher than the PCPT calculator and PSA alone (80.1%, 74.4%, and 64.3%, respectively). Calibration plots showed better performance for the ERSPC calculator; nevertheless, ERSPC may underestimate risk, while PCPT tends to overestimate predictions. Decision curve analysis displayed higher net benefit for the ERSPC calculator; 9% and 23% unnecessary biopsies can be avoided if a threshold probability of 20% and 30%, respectively, is adopted. In contrast, the PCPT model displayed very limited benefit. Our findings apply to a screened European cohort submitted to extended biopsy schemes; consequently, caution should be exerted when considering different populations.
Conclusions: The ERSPC risk calculator, by incorporating several risks factors, can aid in the estimation of individual PCa risk and in the decision to perform biopsy. The ERSPC calculator outperformed the PCPT model, which is of very limited value, in a contemporary cohort of screened patients."

Method: The prediction model was derived from 28,115 men in the Japan Public Health Center-based (JPHC) Prospective Study Cohort II (follow-up: 1993-2005), with risk factors selected by Cox proportion hazard regression. 18,256 men in the JPHC Study Cohort I (follow-up: 1995-2005) were used to evaluate the model's performance.
Results: 543 and 398 CRCs were diagnosed during the follow-up period in Cohorts II and I, respectively. The prediction model, including age, BMI, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and the daily physical activity level, showed modest discrimination ability for CRC (C=0.70; 95% confidential interval, 0.68-0.72) in Cohort II and well calibrated in Cohort I (Hosmer-Lemeshow 蠂(2)=14.2, P=0.08).

In this article, we compared three different measurements (absolute dense area, percent dense area and percent dense volume) from each of four mammograms [left, right, medio-lateral oblique (MLO) and cranio-caudal (CC) views] using three different methods of measurement [computer-assisted thresholding, visual assessment and standard mammogram form (SMF)] to investigate whether additional measurements and/or different methods of measurement provide more information in the prediction of breast cancer risk. Mammographic density was measured in all four mammograms from 318 cases and 899 age-matched controls combined from the Cambridge and Norwich Breast Screening Programmes. Measurements were averaged across various combinations of mammogram type and/or view. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios associated with increasing quintiles of each mammographic measure. Overall, there appeared to be no difference in the fit of the models using two or four mammograms compared to the models using just the contralateral MLO or CC mammogram (all P > 0.07) for all methods of measurement.

This study aimed to develop nomograms for predicting hepatocellular carcinoma risk in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Patients and methods: Two thirds of the Risk Evaluation of Viral Load Elevation and Associated Liver Disease/Cancer-Hepatitis B Virus (REVEAL-HBV) study cohort was allocated for model derivation (n = 2,435), and the remaining third was allocated for model validation (n = 1,218). Previously confirmed independent risk predictors included in three Cox proportional hazards regression models were sex, age, family history of hepatocellular carcinoma, alcohol consumption habit, serum ALT level, hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg) serostatus, serum HBV DNA level, and HBV genotype. Regression coefficients were rounded into integer risk scores, and predicted risk over 5- and 10-year periods for each risk score was calculated and depicted in nomograms. The predictive accuracy was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the correlation between predicted and observed hepatocellular carcinoma risk.
Results: All selected risk predictors were statistically significant in all models. In each model, either HBeAg seropositivity or HBeAg seronegativity with high viral load (HBV DNA level >or= 100,000 copies/mL) and genotype C infection had the highest risk scores. All AUROCs for risk prediction nomogram were >or= 0.82 in both model derivation and validation sets.

The extent to which these variants add to existing risk-assessment models is unknown.
Methods: We used information on traditional risk factors and 10 common genetic variants associated with breast cancer in 5590 case subjects and 5998 control subjects, 50 to 79 years of age, from four U.S. cohort studies and one case-control study from Poland to fit models of the absolute risk of breast cancer. With the use of receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) as a measure of discrimination. By definition, random classification of case and control subjects provides an AUC of 50%; perfect classification provides an AUC of 100%. We calculated the fraction of case subjects in quintiles of estimated absolute risk after the addition of genetic variants to the traditional risk model.
Results: The AUC for a risk model with age, study and entry year, and four traditional risk factors was 58.0%; with the addition of 10 genetic variants, the AUC was 61.8%. About half the case subjects (47.2%) were in the same quintile of risk as in a model without genetic variants; 32.5% were in a higher quintile, and 20.4% were in a lower quintile.
Conclusions: The inclusion of newly discovered genetic factors modestly improved the performance of risk models for breast cancer. The level of predicted breast-cancer risk among most women changed little after the addition of currently available genetic information."

We assessed risk calculator performance in a large contemporary cohort of patients sampled by extended biopsy schemes.
Materials and methods: The validation cohort comprised 3,482 men who underwent a total of 4,515 prostate biopsies. Calculator performance was evaluated by ROC AUC and calibration plots. A multivariate regression model was fitted to address important predictor variables in the validation data set. Prediction error was calculated as the response variable in another multivariate regression model.
Results: Using an average of 13 cores per biopsy prostate cancer was detected in 1,862 patients. The calculator showed an AUC of 0.57 to predict all cancers and 0.60 for high grade cancer. Multivariate analysis of the predictive ability of various clinical factors revealed that race and the number of biopsy cores did not predict overall or high grade cancer at biopsy. Prior negative biopsy, patient age and free prostate specific antigen were significantly associated with prediction error for overall and high grade cancer. Race and family history had a significant association with prediction error only for high grade disease.
Conclusions: To our knowledge our external validation of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator was done in the largest cohort of men screened for prostate cancer to date. Results suggest that the current calculator remains predictive but does not maintain initial accuracy in contemporary patients sampled by more extensive biopsy schemes. Data suggest that the predictive ability of the calculator in current clinical practice may be improved by modeling contemporary data and/or incorporating additional prognostic variables."

This study was designed to evaluate the performance of the Gail model for Turkish female population. Additionally duration of breastfeeding was examined as a possible risk factor. Our analysis included 650 patients with invasive breast carcinoma (group 1) and 640 women with negative results who had undergone a screening mammography on visiting a mammary care unit (group 2). Two groups were compared with regard to individual risk factors included in the Gail model and also duration of breastfeeding. The Gail model was used to predict 5-year risk for each woman. Age and first live birth > or =30 years were associated with an increased relative risk for breast cancer development. Age at menarche, previous breast biopsy, atypical hyperplasia, and number of first degree relatives with breast cancer were found to be non-significant. The Gail model showed 13.3% sensitivity and 92% specificity in estimating the risk of breast cancer development in Turkish women. Positive predictive value was 63%, negative predictive value was 51.9%, and validity index was 53.1%. Duration of breastfeeding was significantly longer in group 1 than 2 (median 17 vs. 13 months). The proportion of parous women with no breastfed was higher in group 1 than 2. The currently used Gail model does not seem to be an appropriate breast cancer risk assessment tool for Turkish female population."

Objective: We aimed to develop strategies to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies while still detecting most clinically important PC cases.
Design, setting, and participants: In 1850 men initially screened and biopsied (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] value > or =3.0 ng/ml) in the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, we calculated both the probability of having a positive lateralized sextant biopsy [P(biop+)] and the probability of having an indolent cancer [P(ind)] if PC was detected at biopsy (n=541). Analyses of repeat screening included 225 cancers in 1201 men.
Interventions: The P(biop+) was based on applying a logistic regression model that included ultrasound volume, digital rectal exam, and transrectal ultrasound in addition to the PSA value. The P(ind) was based on a recently validated nomogram. MEASUREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS: At initial screening the fraction of positive biopsies was 29% (541 of 1850). Applying an additional P(biop+) cut-off of 12.5% implied that 613 of the 1850 men (33%) would not have been biopsied. This would result in an increase in the positive predictive value (PPV) to 38% (468 of 1237).

Methods: Criteria that are based on four clinical or public health applications were used to compare BCRAT with BCRATplus7, which includes the seven genotypes. Criteria included number of expected life-threatening events for the decision to take tamoxifen, expected decision losses (in units of the loss from giving a mammogram to a woman without detectable breast cancer) for the decision to have a mammogram, rates of risk reclassification, and number of lives saved by risk-based allocation of screening mammography. For all calculations, the following assumptions were made: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, linkage equilibrium across SNPs, additive effects of alleles at each locus, no interactions on the logistic scale among SNPs or with factors in BCRAT, and independence of SNPs from factors in BCRAT.
Results: Improvements in expected numbers of life-threatening events were only 0.07% and 0.81% for deciding whether to take tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer for women aged 50-59 and 40-49 years, respectively. For deciding whether to recommend screening mammograms to women aged 50-54 years, the reduction in expected losses was 0.86% if the ideal breast cancer prevalence threshold for recommending mammography was that of women aged 50-54 years. Cross-classification of risks indicated that some women classified by BCRAT would have different classifications with BCRATplus7, which might be useful if BCRATplus7 was well calibrated. Improvements from BCRATplus7 were small for risk-based allocation of mammograms under costs constraints.
Conclusions: The gains from BCRATplus7 are small in the applications examined. Models with SNPs, such as BCRATplus7, have not been validated for calibration in independent cohort data. Additional studies are needed to validate a model with SNPs and justify its use."

Methods: Based on the results of our previous case-control study, we invented HRA models that enable screening for EPSCC cases in Japanese men with high sensitivity and specificity based on either their aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genotype (HRA-G model) or alcohol flushing (HRA-F model) and drinking, smoking, and dietary habits. Follow-up endoscopy combined with esophageal iodine staining (median follow-up period: 5.0 years) was done on 404 Japanese men (50-78 years) who were registered as cancer-free controls in the previous study.
Results: The follow-up endoscopy resulted in a diagnosis of 6 esophageal SCC (T(is) in 5 and T(1) in 1), 1 hypopharyngeal SCC (T(2)), and 1 oropharyngeal SCC (T(2)). Seven and 6 of the 8 EPSCC cases were in the top 10% risk group at baseline according to the HRA-G and HRA-F models, respectively. The EPSCC detection rates per 100 person-years in the top 10% risk groups by the HRA-G and HRA-F models were 4.38 (95% confidence interval, 1.76-9.01) and 3.48 (95% confidence interval, 1.28-7.58), respectively.

Because identification of these patients represents a difficult task, we assessed the ability of percent free PSA to discriminate between benign and malignant prostate biopsy outcomes in men with PSA < or =2.5 ng/mL.
Methods: Between 1999 and 2006, 543 men with a PSA < or =2.5 ng/mL were referred for initial prostate biopsy. Age, total PSA, percent free PSA, and digital rectal examination findings represented predictors of prostate cancer at biopsy in logistic regression models. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) quantified the discriminative ability of the predictors. The pathological characteristics of the detected cancers were assessed in individuals treated with radical prostatectomy.
Results: Of all, 23% had prostate cancer on biopsy, 16.5% of patients treated with radical prostatectomy had pT3 stage, and 35.6% had a pathological Gleason score of 3 + 4 or higher. The most accurate predictor of prostate cancer on biopsy was percent free PSA (0.68) versus age (0.50), total PSA (0.57), or rectal examination findings (0.58). Of patients with percent free PSA below 14%, 59% had prostate cancer. In multivariate models, percent free PSA (P < .001) and rectal examination findings (P = .001) were the only independent predictors of prostate cancer. The combined AUC of all predictors (0.69) was not significantly (P = .7) higher than that of percentage of free PSA alone (0.68).

Methods: In this prospective study, 9941 postmenopausal women who had a baseline hip BMD and Gail score from the Women's Health Initiative were included in the analysis. Their average age was 63.0 +/- 7.4 years at baseline.
Results: After an average of 8.43 years of follow-up, 327 incident breast cancer cases were reported and adjudicated. In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, the hazards ratios (95% confidence interval [95% CI]) for incident breast cancer were 1.35 (95% CI, 1.05-1.73) for high Gail score (>or=1.67%) and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.11-1.40) for each unit of increase in the total hip BMD T-score. Restricting the analysis to women with both BMD and a Gail score above the median, a sharp increase in incident breast cancer for women with the highest BMD and Gail scores was found (P < .05).
Conclusions: The contribution of BMD to the prediction of incident postmenopausal breast cancer across the entire population was found to be independent of the Gail score. However, among women with both high BMD and a high Gail score, there appears to be an interaction between these 2 factors.

Although circulating levels of estradiol in postmenopausal women predict subsequent breast cancer risk, whether the addition of estradiol levels adds significantly to a model's predictive power has not previously been evaluated.
Methods: Using linear regression, the authors developed an imputed estradiol score using measured estradiol levels (the outcome) and both case status and risk factor data (for example, body mass index) from a nested case-control study conducted within a large prospective cohort study and used multiple imputation methods to develop an overall risk model including both risk factor data from the main cohort and estradiol levels from the nested case-control study.
Results: The authors evaluated the addition of imputed estradiol level to the previously published Rosner and Colditz log-incidence model for breast cancer risk prediction within the larger Nurses' Health Study cohort. The follow-up was from 1980 to 2000; during this time, 1,559 invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cases were confirmed. The addition of imputed estradiol levels significantly improved risk prediction; the age-specific concordance statistic increased from 0.635 +/- 0.007 to 0.645 +/- 0.007 (P < 0.001) after the addition of imputed estradiol.
Conclusion: Circulating estradiol levels in postmenopausal women appear to add to other lifestyle factors in predicting a woman's individual risk of breast cancer."

Most current methods of measuring breast density are area based and subjective. Standard mammogram form (SMF) is a computer program using a volumetric approach to estimate the percent density in the breast. The aim of this study is to evaluate the current implementation of SMF as a predictor of breast cancer risk by comparing it with other widely used density measurement methods. The case-control study comprised 634 cancers with 1,880 age-matched controls combined from the Cambridge and Norwich Breast Screening Programs. Data collection involved assessing the films based both on Wolfe's parenchymal patterns and on visual estimation of percent density and then digitizing the films for computer analysis (interactive threshold technique and SMF). Logistic regression was used to produce odds ratios associated with increasing categories of breast density. Density measures from all four methods were strongly associated with breast cancer risk in the overall population. The stepwise rises in risk associated with increasing density as measured by the threshold method were 1.37 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.03-1.82], 1.80 (95% CI, 1.36-2.37), and 2.45 (95% CI, 1.86-3.23). For each increasing quartile of SMF density measures, the risks were 1.11 (95% CI, 0.85-1.46), 1.31 (95% CI, 1.00-1.71), and 1.92 (95% CI, 1.47-2.51).

We computed the c-statistic by comparing the risks found in our population to those in Gail-US population. The concordance for the model with FDR was 0.55 (95% CI 0.53-0.58), the model with SDR shows a modest but significant discriminatory accuracy (0.56, 95% CI 0.53-0.59), and the combination of FDR+SDR gave the concordance statistic of 0.57 (95% CI 0.54-0.60), indicating a good comparison between the two models.

Objective: To develop and validate an easy-to-use breast cancer risk prediction model that includes breast density.
Design: Empirical model based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results incidence, and relative hazards from a prospective cohort.
Setting: Screening mammography sites participating in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium.
Patients: 1,095,484 women undergoing mammography who had no previous diagnosis of breast cancer.
Measurements: Self-reported age, race or ethnicity, family history of breast cancer, and history of breast biopsy. Community radiologists rated breast density by using 4 Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System categories.
Results: During 5.3 years of follow-up, invasive breast cancer was diagnosed in 14,766 women. The breast density model was well calibrated overall (expected-observed ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.06]) and in racial and ethnic subgroups. It had modest discriminatory accuracy (concordance index, 0.66 [CI, 0.65 to 0.67]). Women with low-density mammograms had 5-year risks less than 1.67% unless they had a family history of breast cancer and were older than age 65 years.
Limitation: The model has only modest ability to discriminate between women who will develop breast cancer and those who will not.
Conclusion: A breast cancer prediction model that incorporates routinely reported measures of breast density can estimate 5-year risk for invasive breast cancer. Its accuracy needs to be further evaluated in independent populations before it can be recommended for clinical use."

We developed a model for projecting absolute risk of invasive breast cancer in African American women and compared its projections with those from the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool.
Methods: Data from 1607 African American women with invasive breast cancer and 1647 African American control subjects in the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences (CARE) Study were used to compute relative and attributable risks that were based on age at menarche, number of affected mother or sisters, and number of previous benign biopsy examinations. Absolute risks were obtained by combining this information with data on invasive breast cancer incidence in African American women from the NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program and with national mortality data. Eligibility screening data from the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial were used to determine how the new model would affect eligibility, and independent data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) were used to assess how well numbers of invasive breast cancers predicted by the new model agreed with observed cancers.
Results: Tables and graphs for estimating relative risks and projecting absolute invasive breast cancer risk with confidence intervals were developed for African American women. Relative risks for family history and number of biopsies and attributable risks estimated from the CARE population were lower than those from the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, as was the discriminatory accuracy (i.e., concordance).

Patients and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 3,108 men who underwent a prostate biopsy, including a subset of 408 volunteers with normal PSA levels. Factors including age, family history of PC (FHPC), ethnicity, urinary symptoms, PSA, free:total PSA ratio, and digital rectal examination (DRE) were incorporated in the model. A nomogram was constructed to assess risk for any and high-grade PC (Gleason score >or= 7).
Results: Of the 3,108 men, 1,304 (42.0%) were found to have PC. Among the 408 men with a normal PSA (< 4.0 ng/mL), 99 (24.3%) had PC.

The strongest correlation of p(life) was shown by BRCAPRO(Ford)/MENDEL, at r=0.69; no correlation was shown by BRCAPRO(Claus)/MENDEL, at r=0.018. The Tyrer-Cuzick model had the strongest correlations with MENDEL and BRCAPRO(Ford). For MENDEL and BRCAPRO, low correlation or p(mut)-prediction was improved by excluding kindreds with ovarian cancer. p(mut) showed the best accuracy for BRCAPRO(Ford) and MENDEL. BRCAPRO and MENDEL are useful tools for calculating p(mut). They can provide support in decision-making for or against genetic analysis. Estimations of p(life) and p(mut) based on a mathematical model should use algorithms and penetrance/frequency data appropriate to the population counseled. Reproductive/hormonal data, should be incorporated as Tyrer-Cuzick does."

Methods: We used data from a multicenter case-control study in Italy and from Italian cancer registries to develop a model (IT-GM) that uses the same risk factors as the GM. We evaluated the accuracy of the IT-GM and the GM using independent data from the Florence-European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort.

That model also included the variables age at birth of first live child (AGEFLB), number of affected mother or sisters (NUMREL), number of previous benign breast biopsy examinations (NBIOPS), and weight (WEIGHT). In this study, we developed the corresponding model for absolute risk.
Methods: We combined the relative risk model with data on the distribution of the variables AGEFLB, NUMREL, NBIOPS, and WEIGHT from the 2000 National Health Interview Survey, with data on the conditional distribution of DENSITY given other risk factors in BCDDP, with breast cancer incidence rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program of the National Cancer Institute, and with national mortality rates. Confidence intervals (CIs) accounted for variability of estimates of relative risks and of risk factor distributions. We compared the absolute 5-year risk projections from the new model with those from the Gail model on 1744 white women.
Results: Attributable risks of breast cancer associated with DENSITY, AGEFLB, NUMREL, NBIOPS, and WEIGHT were 0.779 (95% CI = 0.733 to 0.819) and 0.747 (95% CI = 0.702 to 0.788) for women younger than 50 years and 50 years or older, respectively. The model predicted higher risks than the Gail model for women with a high percentage of dense breast area. However, the average risk projections from the new model in various age groups were similar to those from the Gail model, suggesting that the new model is well calibrated.
Conclusions: This new model for absolute invasive breast cancer risk in white women promises modest improvements in discriminatory power compared with the Gail model but needs to be validated with independent data."

Materials and methods: The institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant study; informed consent was not required. Results of 111 consecutive image-guided breast biopsies performed for microcalcifications deemed suspicious by radiologists were analyzed. Mammograms obtained before biopsy were analyzed in a blinded manner by a breast imager who recorded Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) descriptors and provided a probability of malignancy. The BN uses probabilistic relationships between breast disease and mammography findings to estimate the risk of malignancy. Probability estimates from the radiologist and the BN were used to create receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and area under the ROC curve (A(z)) values were compared. PPV of biopsy was also evaluated on the basis of these probability estimates.
Results: The BN and the radiologist achieved A(z) values of 0.919 and 0.916, respectively, which were not significantly different. If the 34 patients estimated by the BN to have less than a 10% probability of malignancy had not undergone biopsy, the PPV of biopsy would have increased from 21.6% to 31.2% without missing a breast cancer (P < .001). At this level, the radiologist's probability estimation improved the PPV to 30.0% (P < .001).
Conclusion: A probabilistic model that includes BI-RADS descriptors for microcalcifications can distinguish between benign and malignant abnormalities at mammography as well as a breast imaging specialist can and may be able to improve the PPV of image-guided breast biopsy."

Aim: To develop a statistical model including non-invasive parameters able to identify patients at high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.
Methods: One hundred and fifty-eight patients (73F:85M) with compensated chronic hepatitis C virus liver disease underwent evaluation, including argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions proliferation index, and were followed up for 56.18 +/- 1.44 months.
Results: Fifty-six patients had chronic hepatitis without cirrhosis and low argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions proliferation index (< or =25%), 65 had hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis and low argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions proliferation index and 37 had hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis and high argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions proliferation index (>25%). Groups were similar for gender and viral genotype distribution. None of the patients with chronic hepatitis without cirrhosis developed hepatocellular carcinoma, compared with 6.1% of low argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions proliferation index and 30.6% of high argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions proliferation index (P = 0.002). By multivariable logistic regression analysis, the following parameters were independently associated with hepatocellular carcinoma development and used for the development of the statistical model: platelets (OR 0.98), gamma-globulins (OR 0.111), alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase ratio (OR 0.07), serum ferritin (OR 1.0) and ultrasonographic pattern (coarse OR 2.9, coarse nodular OR 10.12). The statistical model properly allocated 95.9% of patients with low argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions proliferation index and 72.2% of patients with high argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions proliferation index.

Methods: This population-based case-control study was carried out from January 2002 to April 2004. One hundred and nineteen pancreatic cancer patients and 238 healthy people completed the questionnaire which was used for risk factor analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratio (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (Cls) and beta value, which were further used to establish the risk model.
Results: According to the study, people who have smoked more than 17 pack-years had a higher risk to develop pancreatic cancer compared to non-smokers or light smokers (not more than 17 pack-years) (OR 1.98; 95% CI 1.11-3.49, P = 0.017). More importantly, heavy smokers in men had increased risk for developing pancreatic cancer (OR 2.11; 95%CI 1.18-3.78, P = 0.012) than women. Heavy alcohol drinkers (>20 cup-years) had increased risk for pancreatic cancer (OR 3.68; 95%CI 1.60-8.44). Daily diet with high meat intake was also linked to pancreatic cancer. Moreover, 18.5% of the pancreatic cancer patients had diabetes mellitus compared to the control group of 5.8% (P = 0.0003). Typical symptoms of pancreatic cancer were anorexia, upper abdominal pain, bloating, jaundice and weight loss. Each risk factor was assigned a value to represent its importance associated with pancreatic cancer. Subsequently by adding all the points together, a risk scoring model was established with a value higher than 45 as being at risk to develop pancreatic cancer.

Such models can help clinicians to choose appropriate preventive and therapeutic interventions for each patient. Unfortunately, the validity of these models has not been tested outside the USA.
Methods: The authors describe a case-control study in the Czech Republic with a similar design to that of the US Breast Cancer Detection and Demonstration Project (BCDDP). The main objective of the study was to evaluate the validity of the Gail model in the Czech female population, and to develop a local model using the same statistical approach as the Gail model. Between November 2000 and May 2004, 14,566 questionnaires containing case history data from both healthy women (control group) and women with breast cancer were collected. Case-control age-matched pairs (n = 4598) have subsequently been matched and analyzed.
Results: Our results show that the original Gail model was not able to properly distinguish between controls and breast cancer cases in the Czech female population. Based on paired data, the mean 5-year and life-time breast cancer risk was 1.379 +/- 0.668 and 7.990 +/- 3.184 in the control group and 1.375 +/- 0.692 and 8.028 +/- 3.506 in the patients with breast cancer group. The original Gail model was also not able to properly describe age-specific baseline risk of breast cancer development in the Czech population. In response the authors developed two variants of modified/locally adjusted models.
Conclusion: The original Gail model is not an accurate breast cancer risk assessment tool for the Czech female population."

We studied 20 genes in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway as well as several cytokines. For each of these genes, we selected and genotyped haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among 1,383 cases and 780 controls from the CAPS (CAncer Prostate in Sweden) study population. A total of 57 SNPs were included in the final analysis. A data mining method, multifactor dimensionality reduction, was used to explore the interaction effects of SNPs on prostate cancer risk. Interaction effects were assessed for all possible n SNP combinations, where n = 2, 3, or 4. For each n SNP combination, the model providing lowest prediction error among 100 cross-validations was chosen. The statistical significance levels of the best models in each n SNP combination were determined using permutation tests.

The cohort comprised 384 breast cancer patients and 2 control groups: one comprising 166 hospitalized patients and the other comprising 104 nurses and teachers. Two initial models were produced by comparing cases and the 2 control groups, and the final equations were established by selecting highly significant variables of the initial models to test the accuracy of the models in terms of disease probability and predictability. Both the initial models and the final disease-probability models were confirmed to exhibit high degrees of accuracy and predictability. Major risk factors determined by comparing the patients with hospitalized controls were a family history, menstrual regularity, total menstrual duration, age at first full-term pregnancy, and duration of breastfeeding. Major risk factors determined by comparing patients with nurse/teacher controls were age, education level, menstrual regularity, drinking status, and smoking status. The predictive model developed here shows that risk factors for breast cancer differ between Korean and Western subjects in the aspect of breastfeeding behavior. However, identifying the relationship between genetic susceptibility and breast cancer will require further studies with larger samples. In a model with nurse/teacher controls, drinking and higher education were found to be protective variables, whereas smoking was a risk factor. Hence the predictive model in this group could not be generalized to the Korean population; instead, breast cancer incidence needs to be compared among nurses and teachers in a nurse-and-teacher cohort."

Results: The ratios (95% confidence intervals) of expected to observed numbers of breast cancers were 0.48 (0.37 to 0.64) for Gail, 0.56 (0.43 to 0.75) for Claus, 0.49 (0.37 to 0.65) for Ford, and 0.81 (0.62 to 1.08) for Tyrer-Cuzick. The accuracy of the models for individual cases was evaluated using ROC curves. These showed that the area under the curve was 0.735 for Gail, 0.716 for Claus, 0.737 for Ford, and 0.762 for Tyrer-Cuzick.
Conclusion: The Tyrer-Cuzick model is the most consistently accurate model for prediction of breast cancer. The Gail, Claus, and Ford models all significantly underestimate risk, although the accuracy of the Claus model may be improved by adjustments for other risk factors."

The validity of self-selection of high-risk individuals through self-assessment of melanoma risk factors is not known. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of an unsupervised self-administered questionnaire for the self-assessment of melanoma risk. In a case-control study, melanoma cases (n = 202) and controls (n = 202) matched for age and gender filled in a questionnaire about melanoma risk factors. After filling in the questionnaire, all participants were interviewed and examined by a dermatologist in order to compare self-assessment with physician-assessment. The number of naevi, skin phototype and ultraviolet damage to the skin were identified as independent risk factors for melanoma on both self-assessment and physician-assessment. Receiver operating characteristics analysis showed no statistically significant difference between the accuracy of the self-assessment-based model and the model based on physician-assessment. While excluding 90% of the controls, the self-assessment-based high-risk group included 39% (95% confidence interval 31-48%) of the melanoma patients and the physician-assessment-based high-risk group included 42% (95% confidence interval 33-52%) of the melanoma patients. In conclusion, an unsupervised self-administered questionnaire is, to some extent, useful for the identification of individuals at high risk for melanoma. The moderate accuracy of self-assessment and physician-assessment to identify individuals at high risk for melanoma is a limitation for the practicability of targeted melanoma screening in general."

These methods were compared to the ""gold standard"" interview with a trained genetics' professional. The amount and accuracy of information provided by primary care doctors' letters was found to be poor and better information was obtained by sending a postal questionnaire directly to the patient. Because of the high number of low-risk women referred to clinic a questionnaire (the FCAT) was designed to provide reassurance and piloted as part of this study. This paper highlights the importance of using appropriate methods to gather the family history information.

Gail and associates identified five risk factors using the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP) population and developed a model to calculate a composite relative risk (RR). This model is commonly used to counsel women regarding their risk for breast cancer and was used by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project (NSABP) for eligibility for the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial. Because the BCDDP population was composed almost entirely of women 40 years of age or older, our purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Gail model in estimating the risk of breast cancer for women under 40 in the clinical setting. The Gail risk factors were assessed for 124 patients under the age of 40 treated for either ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive breast cancer at the Lahey Hitchcock Medical Center between 1983 and 1995. The RR was calculated using the Gail model. For comparison, two cohorts of women under the age of 40 were used: 107 randomly selected patients who underwent a breast biopsy because of a benign condition and 129 nurses from our institution who responded to a questionnaire that included reproductive and family history information as used in the Gail model. The RR calculated was the RR that existed at the time of the surgical consultation for a suspicious breast lesion. The Tarone-Ware method was used to analyze statistical significance of differences between distribution. Contingency tables were analyzed using Miettinen's modification of Fisher's exact test. No differences were found between the median RR for all groups. Only 2 of the 124 patients with breast cancer had a RR of 5 or more (the RR required to enter the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial). The distribution of age at menarche (AGEMEN) was the same for each group. No difference was found for the distribution of age at first live birth (AGEFLB) between those with breast cancer and those with a benign biopsy or the control group. The number of breast biopsies (NBIOPS) was higher in patients with a benign breast biopsy. No difference was found in the distribution of number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer (NUMREL).

Methods: A prospective study was performed over 1-year period (7/99-7/00) of women presenting to the gynecology and gynecologic oncology clinics at a public hospital. All women ages 35-60 years with no personal history of breast cancer were offered testing utilizing the computerized Gail model provided by the National Cancer Institute. Age, race, age at menarche, age at first live birth, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, number of breast biopsies, and number of breast biopsies diagnosed as atypical hyperplasia were documented. A calculated 5-year risk > or =1.67% was considered high-risk.
Results: In all, 319 women enrolled, 121 (38%) with a history of gynecologic cancer and 198 (62%) without. The mean age was 46.9 years (range 35-60), and 28 (8.8%) patients had at least one first-degree relative with breast cancer. Ethnicity included 206 (65%) African American, 52 (16%) Caucasian, 45 (14%) Hispanic, and 16 (5%) oriental. Eight (2.5%) women had a 5-year risk > or =1.67%. The mean 5-year risk for all patients was 0.68% (0.55% for African American versus 0.90% for Caucasian/other, P < 0.001).

The purpose of our study was to determine whether the cytologic appearance of epithelial cells obtained from breast random periareolar fine-needle aspirates or molecular marker expression in these cells was associated with later breast cancer development.
Methods: : Four hundred eighty women who were eligible on the basis of a family history of breast cancer, prior precancerous biopsy, and/or prior invasive cancer were enrolled in a single-institution, prospective trial. Their risk of breast cancer according to the Gail model was calculated, and random periareolar fine-needle aspiration was performed at study entry. Cells were characterized morphologically and analyzed for DNA aneuploidy by image analysis and for the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, estrogen receptor, p53 protein, and HER2/NEU protein by immunocytochemistry. All statistical tests are two-sided.
Results: : At a median follow-up time of 45 months after initial aspiration, 20 women have developed breast cancer (invasive disease in 13 and ductal carcinoma in situ in seven). With the use of multiple logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards analysis, subsequent cancer was predicted by evidence of hyperplasia with atypia in the initial fine-needle aspirate and a 10-year Gail projected probability of developing breast cancer. Although expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, estrogen receptor, p53, and HER2/NEU was statistically significantly associated with hyperplasia with atypia, it did not predict the development of breast cancer in multivariable analysis.
Conclusion: : Cytomorphology from breast random periareolar fine-needle aspirates can be used with the Gail risk model to identify a cohort of women at very high short-term risk for developing breast cancer.

We extracted 14 features from the central breast region on digitized mammograms to characterize the mammographic parenchymal patterns of women at different risk levels. Two different approaches were employed to relate these mammographic features to breast cancer risk. In one approach, the features were used to distinguish mammographic patterns seen in low-risk women from those who inherited a mutated form of the BRCA1/BRCA2 gene, which confers a very high risk of developing breast cancer. In another approach, the features were related to risk as determined from existing clinical models (Gail and Claus models), which use well-known epidemiological factors such as a woman's age, her family history of breast cancer, reproductive history, etc. Stepwise linear discriminant analysis was employed to identify features that were useful in differentiating between ""low-risk"" women and BRCA1/BRCA2-mutation carriers. Stepwise linear regression analysis was employed to identify useful features in predicting the risk, as estimated from the Gail and Claus models. Similar computer-extracted mammographic features were identified in the two approaches. Results show that women at high risk tend to have dense breasts and their mammographic patterns tend to be coarse and low in contrast."

A modification of this model to project the absolute risk of developing only invasive breast cancer is referred to herein as model 2. We assessed the validity of both models by employing data from women enrolled in the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial.
Methods: We used data from 5969 white women who were at least 35 years of age and without a history of breast cancer. These women were in the placebo arm of the trial and were screened annually. The average follow-up period was 48.4 months. We compared the observed number of breast cancers with the predicted numbers from the models.
Results: In terms of absolute risk, the ratios of total expected to observed numbers of cancers (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were 0.84 (0. 73-0.97) for model 1 and 1.03 (0.88-1.21) for model 2, respectively. Within the age groups of 49 years or less, 50-59 years, and 60 years or more, the ratios of expected to observed numbers of breast cancers (95% CIs) for model 1 were 0.91 (0.73-1.14), 0.96 (0.73-1. 28), and 0.66 (0.52-0.86), respectively. Thus, model 1 underestimated breast cancer risk in women more than 59 years of age. For model 2, the risk ratios (95% CIs) were 0.93 (0.72-1.22), 1.13 (0.83-1.55), and 1.05 (0.80-1.41), respectively. Both models exhibited a tendency to overestimate risk for women classified in the higher quintiles of predicted 5-year risk and to underestimate risk for those in the lower quintiles of the same.
Conclusion: Despite some limitations, these methods provide useful information on breast cancer risk for women who plan to participate in an annual mammographic screening program."

We propose a new model for the detection of prostate cancer using the percentage of free PSA (%FPSA) in the limited range of PSA values between 2.51 and 4 ng/mL that maximizes clinical specificity (ie, minimizes false-positive results). This model identifies higher risk patients in this relatively low-risk population.
Methods: Three hundred sixty-eight archived serum samples from men evaluated and treated at two academic institutions were reviewed. All men had a histologic diagnosis, findings not suspicious for cancer on DRE, and PSA levels between 2.51 and 4 ng/mL. Samples were tested in Hybritech's Tandem-R PSA and Tandem-R free PSA (FPSA) assays in the same laboratory at each institution.
Results: Various models for cancer detection using %FPSA when PSA is 2.51 to 4 ng/mL and DRE is not suspicious for cancer are proposed. These models recommend biopsy for only 10% to 36% of the men in this population and would identify as many as 30% to 54% of the detectable cancers. There is evidence that the cancers that would be detected are the most aggressive cancers in this population.
Conclusions: Our models identified men with a higher risk of prostate cancer in a relatively low-risk population that currently does not routinely undergo biopsy.

Four variables are analyzed for inclusion in the model: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, digital rectal examination (DRE) results, race, and age.
Methods: Two populations were used to develop and validate the test: a model (n = 633) and an independent, geographically separate, external population (n = 766). Pathology records for patients who underwent prostate biopsy between 1991 and 1995 were reviewed and screened for the presence of PSA and DRE results. Records where age and race could be determined were extracted. Multiple logistic regression was used with an iterative approach to optimize each test factor. The Wald chi-square test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and Hosmer-Lemingshaw test were used to evaluate the model's predictive capability in the two populations.
Results: The model and external populations were significantly different for racial mix, PSA level, age, and biopsy detection rate, providing diverse populations to validate the test. Within a combined model, PSA, DRE, race, and age all demonstrated independent capability to predict cancer at biopsy. Predictive power of the overall test was high within the model population (ROC 80.8%), with minimal loss of power in the external population. The test demonstrated no significant lack of fit in either population.

Results: Seven independent risk factors were identified from 18 clinical variables, which included the pleural fluid carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), serum cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1), the ratio of CEA in the pleural fluid to serum, extrathoracic cancer history (>5 years), tumor size, vessel convergence, and lobulation. The AUCs of the three models were 0.976, 0.927, and 0.944 in the training set and 0.930, 0.845, and 0.944 in the external set, respectively.

We sought to determine whether individuals at high risk of developing PDAC could be identified early using routinely collected data.
Methods: Electronic health record (EHR) databases from two independent hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, providing inpatient, outpatient, and emergency care, from 1979 through 2017, were used with case-control matching. PDAC cases were selected using International Classification of Diseases 9/10 codes and validated with tumour registries. A data-driven feature selection approach was used to develop neural networks and L2-regularised logistic regression (LR) models on training data (594 cases, 100,787 controls) and compared with a published model based on hand-selected diagnoses ('baseline'). Model performance was validated on an external database (408 cases, 160,185 controls). Three prediction lead times (180, 270 and 365 days) were considered.
Results: The LR model had the best performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71 (confidence interval [CI]: 0.67-0.76) for the training set, and AUC 0.68 (CI: 0.65-0.71) for the validation set, 365 days before diagnosis.

We developed two novel mammogram-based breast cancer risk measures based on image brightness (Cirrocumulus) and texture (Cirrus). Their risk prediction when fitted together, and with an established measure of conventional mammographic density (Cumulus), is not known. We used three studies consisting of: 168 interval cases and 498 matched controls; 422 screen-detected cases and 1197 matched controls; and 354 younger-diagnosis cases and 944 controls frequency-matched for age at mammogram. We conducted conditional and unconditional logistic regression analyses of individually- and frequency-matched studies, respectively. We estimated measure-specific risk gradients as the change in odds per standard deviation of controls after adjusting for age and body mass index (OPERA) and calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). For interval, screen-detected and younger-diagnosis cancer risks, the best fitting models (OPERAs [95% confidence intervals]) involved: Cumulus (1.81 [1.41-2.31]) and Cirrus (1.72 [1.38-2.14]); Cirrus (1.49 [1.32-1.67]) and Cirrocumulus (1.16 [1.03 to 1.31]); and Cirrus (1.70 [1.48 to 1.94]) and Cirrocumulus (1.46 [1.27-1.68]), respectively. The AUCs were: 0.73 [0.68-0.77], 0.63 [0.60-0.66], and 0.72 [0.69-0.75], respectively.

Their risk prediction when fitted together, and with an established measure of conventional mammographic density (Cumulus), is not known. We used three studies consisting of: 168 interval cases and 498 matched controls; 422 screen-detected cases and 1197 matched controls; and 354 younger-diagnosis cases and 944 controls frequency-matched for age at mammogram. We conducted conditional and unconditional logistic regression analyses of individually- and frequency-matched studies, respectively. We estimated measure-specific risk gradients as the change in odds per standard deviation of controls after adjusting for age and body mass index (OPERA) and calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). For interval, screen-detected and younger-diagnosis cancer risks, the best fitting models (OPERAs [95% confidence intervals]) involved: Cumulus (1.81 [1.41-2.31]) and Cirrus (1.72 [1.38-2.14]); Cirrus (1.49 [1.32-1.67]) and Cirrocumulus (1.16 [1.03 to 1.31]); and Cirrus (1.70 [1.48 to 1.94]) and Cirrocumulus (1.46 [1.27-1.68]), respectively. The AUCs were: 0.73 [0.68-0.77], 0.63 [0.60-0.66], and 0.72 [0.69-0.75], respectively. Combined, our new mammogram-based measures have twice the risk gradient for screen-detected and younger-diagnosis breast cancer (P 鈮 10-12 ), have at least the same discriminatory power as the current polygenic risk score, and are more correlated with causal factors than conventional mammographic density. Discovering more information about breast cancer risk from mammograms could help enable risk-based personalised breast screening."

We evaluated the prevalent risk factors and the effectiveness of the Gail model for risk assessment in our local Indian population.
Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database was conducted on patients treated between 2008 and 2013. Six hundred and fifty patients were included in each group. Six questions were taken as per the breast cancer risk assessment tool calculator. A value of over 1.67% was taken as a high risk for breast cancer development.
Results: The mean age of the participant was 50 卤 21.3 years in cases and 41 卤 16.4 years in controls. Age and age at first childbirth >30 years were found to be significant and associated with increased risk of breast carcinoma, but the age at menarche, family history, previous breast biopsy, and atypical hyperplasia was no significant.

Because HCC risk is not homogenous and may decrease with fibrosis regression, we aimed to identify patients with low HCC risk based on the prediction of noninvasive markers and its changes after SVR.
Approach and results: This is a multicenter cohort study, including patients with HCV and compensated advanced fibrosis that achieved SVR after direct antivirals. Clinical and transient elastography (TE) data were registered at baseline, 1 year, and 3 years after the end of treatment (EOT). All patients underwent liver ultrasound scan every 6 months. Patients with clinical evaluation 1 year after EOT were eligible. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed, and predictive models were constructed. HCC occurrence rates were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier. Nine hundred and ninety-three patients were eligible (56% male; 44% female; median age 62 years), 35 developed HCC (3.9%), and the median follow-up was 45 months (range 13-53). Baseline liver stiffness measurement (LSM) (HR 1.040; 95% CI 1.017-1.064), serum albumin (HR 0.400; 95% CI 0.174-0.923), 1-year DeltaLSM (HR 0.993; 95% CI 0.987-0.998), and 1-year FIB-4 score (HR 1.095; 95% CI 1.046-1.146) were independent factors associated with HCC. The TE-based HCC risk model predicted 0% of HCC occurrence at 3 years in patients with score 0 (baseline LSM 鈮 17.3 kPa, albumin >4.2 g/dL, and 1-year DeltaLSM > 25.5%) versus 5.2% in patients with score 1-3 (Harrell's C 0.779; log-rank 0.002). An alternative model with FIB-4 similarly predicted HCC risk.
Conclusions: A combination of baseline and dynamic changes in noninvasive markers may help to identify patients with a very low risk of HCC development after SVR."

Parenchymal analysis of digital mammograms is based on the extraction of computerized measures to build machine learning-based models for the prediction of breast cancer risk. However, the choice of the region of interest (ROI) for feature extraction within the breast remains an open problem. In this work we perform a comparison between five different methods suggested in the literature for automated ROI selection, including the whole breast (WB), the maximum squared (MS), the retro-areolar region (RA), the lattice-based (LB), and the polar-based (PB) selection methods. For the experiments, we built a retrospective dataset of 896 screening mammograms from 224 women (112 cases and 112 healthy controls). The performance of each ROI selection method was measured in terms of the area under the curve (AUC) values. The AUC values varied between 0.55 and 0.79 depending on the method and experimental settings. The best performance on an independent test set was achieved by the MS method (AUC of 0.59, 95% CI: 0.55-0.64). This method is fully-automated and does not require adjusting hyper-parameters. Based on our results, we prompt the use of the MS method for ROI selection in the computerized parenchymal analysis for breast cancer risk assessment."

In the test cohort with 50% prevalence, the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) were 67.4% for DNN, 64.2% for BLUP, 64.5% for BayesA, and 62.4% for LDpred. BLUP, BayesA, and LPpred all generated PRS that followed a normal distribution in the case population. However, the PRS generated by DNN in the case population followed a bimodal distribution composed of two normal distributions with distinctly different means. This suggests that DNN was able to separate the case population into a high-genetic-risk case subpopulation with an average PRS significantly higher than the control population and a normal-genetic-risk case subpopulation with an average PRS similar to the control population. This allowed DNN to achieve 18.8% recall at 90% precision in the test cohort with 50% prevalence, which can be extrapolated to 65.4% recall at 20% precision in a general population with 12% prevalence. Interpretation of the DNN model identified salient variants that were assigned insignificant p values by association studies, but were important for DNN prediction.

Large-scale genotyping studies have identified common variants (primarily single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) with individually modest breast cancer risk that, in aggregate, account for considerable breast cancer susceptibility. Here, we describe the development and empirical validation of an SNP-based polygenic breast cancer risk score.
Methods: A panel of 94 SNPs was examined for association with breast cancer in women of European ancestry undergoing hereditary cancer genetic testing and negative for pathogenic variants in breast cancer susceptibility genes. Candidate polygenic risk scores (PRSs) as predictors of personal breast cancer history were developed through multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for age, cancer history, and ancestry. An optimized PRS was validated in 2 independent cohorts (n = 13,174; n = 141,160).
Results: Within the training cohort (n = 24,259), 4,291 women (18%) had a personal history of breast cancer and 8,725 women (36%) reported breast cancer in a first-degree relative. The optimized PRS included 86 variants and was highly predictive of breast cancer status in both validation cohorts (P = 6.4 脳 10-66; P < 10-325). The odds ratio (OR) per unit standard deviation was consistent between validations (OR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.39 to 1.52]; OR 1.47 [95% CI, 1.45 to 1.49]). In a direct comparison, the 86-SNP PRS outperformed a previously described PRS of 77 SNPs.

Higher categories of background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) increase breast cancer risk. However, current clinical BPE categorization is subjective. OBJECTIVE. Using a semiautomated segmentation algorithm, we calculated quantitative BPE measures and investigated the utility of individual features and feature pairs in significantly predicting subsequent breast cancer risk compared with radiologist-assigned BPE category. METHODS. In this retrospective case-control study, we identified 95 women at high risk of breast cancer but without a personal history of breast cancer who underwent breast MRI. Of these women, 19 subsequently developed breast cancer and were included as cases. Each case was age matched to four control patients (76 control patients total). Sociodemographic characteristics were compared between the cases and matched control patients using the Mann-Whitney U test. From each dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI examination, quantitative fibroglandular tissue and BPE measures were computed by averaging enhancing voxels above enhancement ratio thresholds (0-100%), totaling the enhancing volume above thresholds (BPE volume in cm3), and estimating the percentage of enhancing tissue above thresholds relative to total breast volume (BPE%) on each gadolinium-enhanced phase. For the 91 imaging features generated, we compared predictive performance using conditional logistic regression with 80:20 hold-out cross validation and ROC curve analysis. ROC AUC was the figure of merit. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were also computed. All feature pairs were exhaustively searched to identify those with the highest AUC and Youden index. A DeLong test was used to compare predictive performance (AUCs). RESULTS. Women subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer were more likely to have mild, moderate, or marked BPE (odds ratio, 3.0; 95% CI, 0.9-10.0; p = .07). According to ROC curve analysis, a BPE category threshold greater than minimal resulted in a maximized AUC (0.62) in distinguishing cases from control patients. Compared with BPE category, the first gadolinium-enhanced (phase 1) BPE% at the 30% and 40% enhancement ratio thresholds yielded significantly higher AUC values of 0.85 (p = .0007) and 0.84 (p = .0004), respectively. Feature combinations showed similar AUC values with improved sensitivity. CONCLUSION.

This study aimed to develop and validate a colorectal cancer risk prediction model to identify high-risk individuals with type 2 diabetes. Records of 930 patients with type 2 diabetes were reviewed and data were collected from 1 November 2013 to 31 December 2019. Clinical and demographic parameters were analyzed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. The nomogram to assess the risk of colorectal cancer was constructed and validated by bootstrap resampling. Predictors in the prediction nomogram included age, sex, other blood-glucose-lowering drugs and thiazolidinediones. The nomogram demonstrated moderate discrimination in estimating the risk of colorectal cancer, with Hosmer-Lemeshow test P = 0.837, an unadjusted C-index of 0.713 (95% CI 0.670-0.757) and a bootstrap-corrected C index of 0.708. In addition, the decision curve analysis demonstrated that the nomogram would be clinically useful.

Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening with CT require detailed smoking information and miss many incident lung cancers. An automated deep-learning approach based on chest radiograph images may identify more smokers at high risk for lung cancer who could benefit from screening with CT.
Objective: To develop and validate a convolutional neural network (CXR-LC) that predicts long-term incident lung cancer using data commonly available in the electronic medical record (EMR) (chest radiograph, age, sex, and whether currently smoking).
Design: Risk prediction study.
Setting: U.S. lung cancer screening trials.
Participants: The CXR-LC model was developed in the PLCO (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian) Cancer Screening Trial (n = 41 856). The final CXR-LC model was validated in additional PLCO smokers (n = 5615, 12-year follow-up) and NLST (National Lung Screening Trial) heavy smokers (n = 5493, 6-year follow-up). Results are reported for validation data sets only.
Measurements: Up to 12-year lung cancer incidence predicted by CXR-LC.
Results: The CXR-LC model had better discrimination (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [AUC]) for incident lung cancer than CMS eligibility (PLCO AUC, 0.755 vs. 0.634; P < 0.001). The CXR-LC model's performance was similar to that of PLCOM2012, a state-of-the-art risk score with 11 inputs, in both the PLCO data set (CXR-LC AUC of 0.755 vs. PLCOM2012 AUC of 0.751) and the NLST data set (0.659 vs. 0.650). When compared in equal-sized screening populations, CXR-LC was more sensitive than CMS eligibility in the PLCO data set (74.9% vs. 63.8%; P = 0.012) and missed 30.7% fewer incident lung cancers. On decision curve analysis, CXR-LC had higher net benefit than CMS eligibility and similar benefit to PLCOM2012.
Limitation: Validation in lung cancer screening trials and not a clinical setting.
Conclusion: The CXR-LC model identified smokers at high risk for incident lung cancer, beyond CMS eligibility and using information commonly available in the EMR.

A total of 1115 GCa cases and 1172 controls from the eastern Chinese population were included. Logistic regression models were used to identify SNPs that correlated with the risk of GCa. A predictive model to assess the risk of GCa was established by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and classification and regression tree (CART) were applied to calculate the effect of high-order gene-environment interactions on risk of the cancer.

The results revealed that ASH1L rs80142782, PKLR rs3762272, PRKAA1 rs13361707, MUC1 rs4072037, PSCA rs2294008, and PLCE1 rs2274223 polymorphisms were associated with a risk of GCa. The area under curve considering both genetic factors and BMI was 3.10% higher than that of BMI alone. MDR analysis revealed that rs13361707 and rs4072307 variants and BMI had interaction effects on susceptibility to GCa, with the highest predictive accuracy (61.23%) and cross-validation consistency (100/100). CART analysis also supported this interaction model that non-overweight status and a six SNP panel could synergistically increase the susceptibility to GCa.

754,32758450,Am J Hum Genet,8.1,The developed PRS offers a way for risk-stratified CRC screening and other targeted interventions.,predictive polygenic risk scores (PRS),Ldpred-derived Prs,0.654,,,,,development,"Age, Sex, 1.2 M Genetic Variants",in recent 10 years,2020,America,USA,Colorectal Cancer,"Accurate colorectal cancer (CRC) risk prediction models are critical for identifying individuals at low and high risk of developing CRC, as they can then be offered targeted screening and interventions to address their risks of developing disease (if they are in a high-risk group) and avoid unnecessary screening and interventions (if they are in a low-risk group). As it is likely that thousands of genetic variants contribute to CRC risk, it is clinically important to investigate whether these genetic variants can be used jointly for CRC risk prediction. In this paper, we derived and compared different approaches to generating predictive polygenic risk scores (PRS) from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) including 55,105 CRC-affected case subjects and 65,079 control subjects of European ancestry. We built the PRS in three ways, using (1) 140 previously identified and validated CRC loci; (2) SNP selection based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) clumping followed by machine-learning approaches; and (3) LDpred, a Bayesian approach for genome-wide risk prediction. We tested the PRS in an independent cohort of 101,987 individuals with 1,699 CRC-affected case subjects. The discriminatory accuracy, calculated by the age- and sex-adjusted area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), was highest for the LDpred-derived PRS (AUC = 0.654) including nearly 1.2 M genetic variants (the proportion of causal genetic variants for CRC assumed to be 0.003), whereas the PRS of the 140 known variants identified from GWASs had the lowest AUC (AUC = 0.629). Based on the LDpred-derived PRS, we are able to identify 30% of individuals without a family history as having risk for CRC similar to those with a family history of CRC, whereas the PRS based on known GWAS variants identified only top 10% as having a similar relative risk. About 90% of these individuals have no family history and would have been considered average risk under current screening guidelines, but might benefit from earlier screening. The developed PRS offers a way for risk-stratified CRC screening and other targeted interventions."

However, NA cannot suppress carcinogenesis completely in patients with chronic hepatitis B. The aims of this study were to identify risk factors for HCC and develop a refined carcinogenesis prediction model. Patients receiving NA therapy (n = 1,183) were recruited retrospectively from the 16 hospitals. All patients had been receiving NA continuously for more than 1 year until the end of the follow-up. During a median follow-up of 4.9 (1.0-12.9) years, 52 (4.4%) patients developed HCC. A multivariate analysis revealed that male gender, older age, lower platelet counts at the baseline, and detectable HBV DNA during NA therapy were independent predictive factors of HCC development. The PAGE-B score was calculated by using these factors. 240 (20.3%), 661 (55.9%), and 282 (23.8%) patients were classified into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. In the intermediate- and high-risk group, detectable HBV DNA was significantly associated with a higher risk of HCC development compared with continuously undetectable HBV DNA, respectively (HR 3.338; 95% CI 1.045-10.66/HR 3.191; 95% CI 1.543-6.597).

Our study aimed to develop an ESCC risk prediction model to identify high-risk individuals for population-based esophageal cancer screening. In total, 86 745 participants enrolled in a population-based esophageal cancer screening program in rural China between 2007 and 2012 were included in the present study and followed up until December 31, 2015. Models for identifying individuals at risk of ESCC within 3 years were created using logistic regressions. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) was determined to estimate the model's overall performance. A total of 298 individuals were diagnosed with ESCC within 3 years after baseline. The model of ESCC included the predictors of age, sex, family history of upper gastrointestinal cancer, smoking status, alarming symptoms of retrosternal pain, back pain or neck pain, consumption of salted food and fresh fruits and disease history of peptic ulcer or esophagitis (AUC of 0.81; 95% confidence interval: 0.78-0.83). Compared to the current prescreening strategy in our program, the cut-off value of 10 in the score-based model could result in 3.11% fewer individuals subjected to endoscopies and present higher sensitivity, slightly higher specificity and lower number needed to screen. This score-based risk prediction model of ESCC based on eight epidemiological risk factors could increase the efficiency of the esophageal cancer screening program in rural China."

The estimate of duodenal cancer risk in patients with FAP is critical for selecting the optimal treatment strategy.
Methods: Microarray datasets related with FAP were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes were identified by FAP vs. normal samples and FAP and duodenal cancer vs. normal samples. Furthermore, functional enrichment analyses of these differentially expressed genes were performed. A support vector machine (SVM) was performed to train and validate cancer risk prediction model.
Results: A total of 196 differentially expressed genes were identified between FAP compared with normal samples. 177 similarly expressed genes were identified both in FAP and duodenal cancer, which were mainly enriched in pathways in cancer and metabolic-related pathway, indicating that these genes in patients with FAP could contribute to duodenal cancer. Among them, Cyclin D1, SDF-1, AXIN, and TCF were significantly upregulated in FAP tissues using qRT-PCR. Based on the 177 genes, an SVM model was constructed for prediction of the risk of cancer in patients with FAP. After validation, the model can accurately distinguish FAP patients with high risk from those with low risk for duodenal cancer.
Conclusion: This study proposed a cancer risk prediction model based on an SVM at the transcript levels."

Methods: Since 1989, 6522 women without BC aged 45 or older of European descent have been included in the Rotterdam Study. The PRS313 was calculated per 1 SD in controls from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). Cox regression analysis was performed to estimate the association between the PRS313 and incident BC risk. Cumulative 10-year risks were calculated with BOADICEA including different sets of variables (age, risk factors and PRS313). C-statistics were used to evaluate discriminative ability.
Results: In total, 320 women developed BC. The PRS313 was significantly associated with BC (hazard ratio [HR] per SD of 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.40-1.73]). Using 10-year risk estimates including age and the PRS313, other risk factors improved the discriminatory ability of the BOADICEA model marginally, from a C-statistic of 0.636 to 0.653.
Conclusions: The effect size of the PRS313 is highly reproducible in the Dutch population. Our results validate the BOADICEA v5 model for BC risk assessment in the Dutch general population."

Breast cancer is the commonest female cancer in Slovenia, with an incidence rate below European average. The Tyrer-Cuzick breast cancer risk assessment algorithm was recently adapted to S-IBIS. In Slovenia a tailored mammographic screening for women at above average risk in age group 40-49 years is considered in the future. S-IBIS is a possible tool to select population at above-average risk of breast cancer for tailored screening. Patients and methods In 357 healthy women aged 40-49 years referred for any reason to diagnostic breast centres and in 367 female breast cancer patients aged 40-49 years at time of diagnosis 10-years breast cancer risk was calculated using the S-IBIS software. The proportion of women classified as above-average risk of breast cancer was calculated for each subgroup of the study population. Results 48.7% of women in the Breast centre group and 39.2% of patients in the breast cancer group had above-average 10-year breast cancer risk.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 499 patients who had positive mpMRI (PI-RADSv2 鈮 3) and MRI-targeted biopsy. The training cohort comprised 449 men, including a calibration set of 50 men. Biopsy decision strategies included using risk estimates from the CNN (original and calibrated), to perform biopsy in men with PI-RADSv2 鈮 4 only, or additionally in men with PI-RADSv2 3 and PSA density (PSAd) 鈮 0.15 ng/ml/ml.

Results: The calibrated CNN achieved moderate calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow calibration test, p = 0.41) and good discrimination (C = 0.85). DCA revealed consistently higher net benefit and net reduction in biopsies for the calibrated CNN compared with the original CNN, PI-RADSv2 鈮 4 and the combined strategy of PI-RADSv2 and PSAd.

Conclusions: DCA revealed that our calibrated 3D-CNN resulted in fewer unnecessary biopsies compared with using PI-RADSv2 alone or in combination with PSAd. CNN calibration is important in achieving clinical utility.
Key points: 鈥 A 3D deep learning model applied to multiparametric MRI may help to prevent unnecessary prostate biopsies in patients eligible for MRI-targeted biopsy. 鈥 Owing to miscalibration, original risk estimates by the deep learning model require prior calibration to enable clinical utility. 鈥 Decision curve analysis confirmed a net benefit of using our calibrated deep learning model for biopsy decisions compared with alternative strategies, including PI-RADSv2 alone and in combination with prostate-specific antigen density."

Methods: A retrospective case-control study was carried out with 542 patients whose thyroid nodules were analyzed at our endocrinology department between 2013 and 2018 while undergoing treatment for thyroidectomy. Starting with a multivariate logistic regression analysis, which included clinical, analytic, and ultrasound variables, a predictive model for thyroid cancer (TC) risk was devised. This was then subjected to a cross-validation process, using resampling techniques.
Results: In the final model, the independent predictors of the risk of malignancy were: being male, age of the extremes, family history of TC, thyroid-stimulating hormone level >4.7 渭U/L, presence of autoimmune thyroiditis, solid consistency, hypoechogenicity, irregular or microlobed borders, nodules that are taller than they are wide, microcalcifications, and suspicious adenopathy. With a cut-off point of 50% probability of thyroid cancer, the predictive model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.925 (95% confidence interval 0.898 to 0.952).

Pylori Infection",in recent 10 years,2020,Europe,Sweden,Breast Cancer,"Background: The clinical utility of machine-learning (ML) algorithms for breast cancer risk prediction and screening practices is unknown. We compared classification of lifetime breast cancer risk based on ML and the BOADICEA model. We explored the differences in risk classification and their clinical impact on screening practices.
Methods: We used three different ML algorithms and the BOADICEA model to estimate lifetime breast cancer risk in a sample of 112,587 individuals from 2481 families from the Oncogenetic Unit, Geneva University Hospitals. Performance of algorithms was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC) curve. Risk reclassification was compared for 36,146 breast cancer-free women of ages 20-80. The impact on recommendations for mammography surveillance was based on the Swiss Surveillance Protocol.
Results: The predictive accuracy of ML-based algorithms (0.843 鈮 AU-ROC 鈮 0.889) was superior to BOADICEA (AU-ROC = 0.639) and reclassified 35.3% of women in different risk categories. The largest reclassification (20.8%) was observed in women characterised as 'near population' risk by BOADICEA. Reclassification had the largest impact on screening practices of women younger than 50.
Conclusion: ML-based reclassification of lifetime breast cancer risk occurred in approximately one in three women. Reclassification is important for younger women because it impacts clinical decision- making for the initiation of screening."

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a digestive carcinoma risk prediction model to identify high-risk individuals among those with type 2 diabetes.
Patients and methods: The prediction model was developed in a primary cohort that consisted of 655 patients with type 2 diabetes. Data were collected from November 2013 to December 2018. Clinical parameters and demographic characteristics were analyzed by logistic regression to develop a model to predict the risk of digestive carcinomas锘; then, a nomogram was constructed. The performance of the nomogram was assessed with respect to calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. The results were internally validated by a bootstrapping procedure. The independent validation cohort consisted of 275 patients from January 2019 to December 2019.
Results: Predictors in the prediction nomogram included sex, age, insulin use, and body mass index. The model showed good discrimination (C-index 0.747 [95% CI, 0.718-0.791]) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.541). The nomogram showed similar discrimination in the validation cohort (C-index 0.706 [95% CI, 0.682-0.755]) and good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.418). Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the nomogram would be clinically useful.
Conclusion: We developed a low-cost and low-risk model based on clinical and demographic parameters to help identify patients with type 2 diabetes who might benefit from digestive cancer screening."

However, these have not been validated externally, and their clinical benefit compared with alternative approaches remains unclear.
Objective: To assess previously published PCa RCs incorporating MRI data, and compare their performance with traditional RCs (European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer [ERSPC] 3/4 and Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group [PBCG]) and the blood-based Stockholm3 test.
Design, setting, and participants: RCs were tested in a prospective multicenter cohort including 532 men aged 45-74 yr participating in the Stockholm3-MRI study between 2016 and 2017.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The probabilities of detection of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) defined as Gleason score 鈮3 + 4 were calculated for each patient. For each RC and the Stockholm3 test, discrimination was assessed by area under the curve (AUC), calibration by numerical and graphical summaries, and clinical usefulness by decision curve analysis (DCA).
Results and limitations: The discriminative ability of MRI RCs 1-4 for the detection of csPCa was superior (AUC 0.81-0.87) to the traditional RCs (AUC 0.76-0.80). The observed prevalence of csPCa in the cohort was 37%, but calibration-in-the-large predictions varied from 14% to 63% across models. DCA identified only one model including MRI data as clinically useful at a threshold probability of 10%. The Stockholm3 test achieved equivalent performance for discrimination (AUC 0.86) and DCA, but was underpredicting the actual risk.
Conclusions: Although MRI RCs discriminated csPCa better than traditional RCs, their predicted probabilities were variable in accuracy, and DCA identified only one model as clinically useful.
Patient summary: Novel risk calculators (RCs) incorporating imaging improved the ability to discriminate clinically significant prostate cancer compared with traditional tools. However, all but one predicted divergent compared with actual risks, suggesting that regional modifications be implemented before usage. The Stockholm3 test achieved performance comparable with the best MRI RC without utilization of imaging."

Design: Three elements: (1) analysis of a dataset of 2390 cases of IDA to validate the predictive value of age, sex, blood haemoglobin concentration (Hb), mean cell volume (MCV) and iron studies on the probability of underlying GI cancer; (2) a pilot study of the benefit of adding faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) into the model; and (3) development of an app based on the model.
Results: Age, sex and Hb were all strong, independent predictors of the risk of GI cancer, with ORs (95% CI) of 1.05 per year (1.03 to 1.07, p<0.00001), 2.86 for men (2.03 to 4.06, p<0.00001) and 1.03 for each g/L reduction in Hb (1.01 to 1.04, p<0.0001) respectively.

We aimed to validate a predictive score, generated by a machine learning algorithm with common laboratory test data, to identify patients at high risk for CRC in a large, community-based, ethnically diverse cohort.
Methods: We performed a nested case-control study using data from members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (1996-2015). Cases were cohort members who received a complete blood cell count at ages 50-75 y, did not have a prior or current diagnosis of CRC diagnosis at the time of the blood cell count, and were subsequently diagnosed with CRC. We used data from the cohort to validate the ability of an algorithm that uses laboratory and demographic information to identify patients at increased risk for CRC. Test performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI values to compare high (defined as 97% specificity or more) vs low scores.
Results: A high score from the algorithm identified patients with a CRC diagnosis within the next 6 months with 35.4% sensitivity (95% CI, 33.8-36.7) and an AUROC of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.77-0.78). Patients with a high score had an increased risk of diagnosis with early-stage CRC (OR, 13.1; 95% CI, 11.8-14.3) and advanced stage CRC (OR, 24.8; 95% CI, 22.4-27.3) within the next 6 months. In patients with high scores, the ORs for proximal and distal cancers were 34.7 (95% CI, 31.5-37.7) and 12.1 (95% CI, 10.1-13.9), respectively. The algorithm's accuracy decreased with the time interval between blood test result and CRC diagnosis; performance did not differ by sex or race.
Conclusions: We validated a predictive model that uses complete blood cell count and demographic data to identify patients at high risk of CRC.

Methods: This retrospective nested case-control study used data from a population-based breast screening program (2009-2015). All women aged 40-75 diagnosed with screen-detected or interval breast cancer (n = 1882) were frequency-matched 3:1 on age and screen-year with women without screen-detected breast cancer (n = 5888). Image-derived risk factors from the screening mammogram (percent mammographic density [PMD], breast volume, age) were combined with core biopsy history, first-degree family history, and other clinical risk factors in risk models. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Classifiers assigning women to low- versus high-risk deciles were derived from risk models. Agreement between classifiers was assessed using a weighted kappa.
Results: The AUC was 0.597 for a risk model including only image-derived risk factors. The successive addition of core biopsy and family history significantly improved performance (AUC = 0.660, p < 0.001 and AUC = 0.664, p = 0.04, respectively). Adding the three remaining risk factors did not further improve performance (AUC = 0.665, p = 0.45). There was almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.97) between risk assessments based on a classifier derived from image-derived risk factors, core biopsy, and family history compared with those derived from a model including all available risk factors.
Conclusions: Women in the general screening population can be risk-stratified at time of screen using a simple model based on age, PMD, breast volume, and biopsy and family history.
Key points: 鈥 A breast cancer risk model based on three image-derived risk factors as well as core biopsy and first-degree family history can provide current risk estimates at time of screen. 鈥 Risk estimates generated from a combination of image-derived risk factors, core biopsy history, and first-degree family history may be more valid than risk estimates that rely on extensive self-reported risk factors. 鈥 A simple breast cancer risk model can avoid extensive clinical risk factor data collection."

Risk markers for pancreatic cancer have been characterized, but combined models are not used clinically to identify individuals at high risk for the disease.
Methods: Within a nested case-control study of 500 pancreatic cancer cases diagnosed after blood collection and 1,091 matched controls enrolled in four U.S. prospective cohorts, we characterized absolute risk models that included clinical factors (e.g., body mass index, history of diabetes), germline genetic polymorphisms, and circulating biomarkers.
Results: Model discrimination showed an area under ROC curve of 0.62 via cross-validation. Our final integrated model identified 3.7% of men and 2.6% of women who had at least 3 times greater than average risk in the ensuing 10 years. Individuals within the top risk percentile had a 4% risk of developing pancreatic cancer by age 80 years and 2% 10-year risk at age 70 years.

Such studies often have a two-phase design, where information on expensive biomarkers are ascertained in a nested substudy of the original cohort.
Methods: We propose a simple approach for evaluating model discrimination that accounts for incomplete follow-up and gains efficiency by using data from all individuals in the cohort irrespective of whether they were sampled in the substudy. For evaluating the AUC, we estimated probabilities of risk-scores for cases being larger than those in controls conditional on partial risk-scores, computed using partial covariate information. The proposed method was compared with an inverse probability weighted (IPW) approach that used information only from the subjects in the substudy. We evaluated age-stratified AUC of a model including questionnaire-based risk factors and inflammation biomarkers to predict 10-year risk of lung cancer using data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (1993-2009) trial (30,297 ever-smokers, 1,253 patients with lung cancer).
Results: For estimating age-stratified AUC of the combined lung cancer risk model, the proposed method was 3.8 to 5.3 times more efficient compared with the IPW approach across the different age groups. Extensive simulation studies also demonstrated substantial efficiency gain compared with the IPW approach.
Conclusions: Incorporating information from all individuals in a two-phase cohort study can substantially improve precision of discrimination measures of lung cancer risk models.
Impact: Novel, simple, and practically useful methods are proposed for evaluating risk models, a critical step toward risk-stratified cancer prevention."

Risk prediction models for lung cancer that could accurately identify high-risk populations may help to increase efficiency. We thus sought to develop a risk prediction model for lung cancer incorporating epidemiological and metabolic markers in a Chinese population.
Methods: During 2006 and 2015, a total of 122 497 people were observed prospectively for lung cancer incidence with the total person-years of 976 663. Stepwise multivariable-adjusted logistic regressions with Pentry = .15 and Pstay = .20 were conducted to select the candidate variables including demographics and metabolic markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) into the prediction model. We used the C-statistic to evaluate discrimination, and Hosmer-Lemeshow tests for calibration. Tenfold cross-validation was conducted for internal validation to assess the model's stability.
Results: A total of 984 lung cancer cases were identified during the follow-up. The epidemiological model including age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake status, coal dust exposure status, and body mass index generated a C-statistic of 0.731. The full model additionally included hsCRP and LDL-C showed significantly better discrimination (C-statistic = 0.735, P = .033). In stratified analysis, the full model showed better predictive power in terms of C-statistic in younger participants (<50 years, 0.709), females (0.726), and former or current smokers (0.742). The model calibrated well across the deciles of predicted risk in both the overall population (PHL = .689) and all subgroups.
Conclusions: We developed and internally validated an easy-to-use risk prediction model for lung cancer among the Chinese population that could provide guidance for screening and surveillance."

We aimed to evaluate the performance of breast cancer risk models developed in European-ancestry studies in a Korean population.
Methods: We compared discrimination and calibration of three multivariable risk models in a cohort of 77,457 women from the Korean Cancer Prevention Study (KCPS)-II. The first incorporated U.S. breast cancer incidence and mortality rates, U.S. risk factor distributions, and RR estimates from European-ancestry studies. The second recalibrated the first by using Korean incidence and mortality rates and Korean risk factor distributions, while retaining the European-ancestry RR estimates. Finally, we derived a Korea-specific model incorporating the RR estimates from KCPS.
Results: The U.S. European-ancestry breast cancer risk model was well calibrated among Korean women <50 years [expected/observed = 1.124 (0.989, 1.278)] but markedly overestimated the risk for those 鈮50 years [E/O = 2.472 (2.005, 3.049)]. Recalibrating absolute risk estimates using Korean breast cancer rates and risk distributions markedly improved the calibration in women 鈮50 [E/O = 1.018 (0.825, 1.255)]. The model incorporating Korean-based RRs had similar but not clearly improved performance relative to the recalibrated model.
Conclusions: The poor performance of the U.S. European-ancestry breast cancer risk model among older Korean women highlights the importance of tailoring absolute risk models to specific populations. Recalibrating the model using Korean incidence and mortality rates and risk factor distributions greatly improved performance.
Impact: The data will provide valuable information to plan and evaluate actions against breast cancer focused on primary prevention and early detection in Korean women."

Combining predictors with FOBTs has shown to improve referral decisions and accuracy. The richer data available from GP databases could be used to complement screening referral decisions by identifying those at greatest risk of colorectal cancer. We determined the availability of data for key predictors and whether this information could be used to inform more accurate screening referral decisions.
Methods: An English BCSP cohort was derived using the electronic notifications received from the BCSP database to GP records. The cohort covered a period between 13th May 2009 to 17th January 2017. Completeness of variables and univariable associations were assessed. Risk prediction models were developed using Cox regression and multivariable fractional polynomials with backwards elimination. Optimism adjusted performance metrics were reported. The sensitivity and specificity of a combined approach using the negative FOBT model plus FOBT positive patients was determined using a probability equivalent to a 3% PPV NICE guidelines level.
Results: 292,059 participants aged 60-74 were derived for the BCSP screening cohort. A model including the screening test result had a C-statistic of 0.860, c-slope of 0.997, and R2 of 0.597. A model developed for negative screening results only had a C-statistic of 0.597, c-slope of 0.940, and R2 of 0.062. Risk predictors included in the models included; age, sex, alcohol consumption, IBS diagnosis, family history of gastrointestinal cancer, smoking status, previous negatives and whether a GP had ordered a blood test. For the combined screening approach, sensitivity increased slightly from 53.90% (FOBT only) to 58.82% but at the expense of an increased referral rate.

Breast cancer has been the most common cancer affecting women in Jordan. In the process of implementing breast cancer prevention and early detection programs, individualized risk assessment can add to the cost-effectiveness of such interventions. Gail model is a widely used tool to stratify patients into different risk categories. However, concerns about its applicability across different ethnic groups do exist. In this study, we report our experience with the application of a modified version of this model among Jordanian women.
Methods: The Gail risk assessment model (RAM) was modified and used to calculate the 5-year and lifetime risk for breast cancer. Patients with known breast cancer were used to test this model. Medical records and hospital database were utilized to collect information on known risk factors. The mean calculated risk score for women tested was 0.65. This number, which corresponds to the Gail original score of 1.66, was used as a cutoff point to categorize patients as high risk.
Results: A total of 1786 breast cancer patients with a mean age of 50 (range: 19-93) years were included. The modified version of the Gail RAM was applied on 1213 patients aged 35-59.9 years. The mean estimated risk for developing invasive breast cancer over the following five years was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.56), and the lifetime risk was 3.42 (95% CI: 3.30, 3.53). Only 210 (17.3%) women had a risk score >0.65 and thus categorized as high risk. First-degree family history of breast cancer was identified among 120 (57.1%) patients in this high-risk group.
Conclusions: Among a group of patients with an established diagnosis of breast cancer, a modified Gail risk assessment model would have been able to stratify only 17% into the high-risk category. The family history of breast cancer contributed the most to the risk score."

Here we assessed the combined genetic effects of these variants on PTC risk by using summarized GWAS results to build polygenic risk score (PRS) models in three PTC study groups from Ohio (1,544 patients and 1,593 controls), Iceland (723 patients and 129,556 controls), and the United Kingdom (534 patients and 407,945 controls). A PRS based on the 10 established PTC SNPs showed a stronger predictive power compared with the clinical factors model, with a minimum increase of area under the receiver-operating curve of 5.4 percentage points (P 鈮 1.0 脳 10-9). Adding an extended PRS based on 592,475 common variants did not significantly improve the prediction power compared with the 10-SNP model, suggesting that most of the remaining undiscovered genetic risk in thyroid cancer is due to rare, moderate- to high-penetrance variants rather than to common low-penetrance variants.

There were 2,679 (0.6%) cases of incident colorectal cancer. We assessed model discrimination using the area under the operating characteristic curve (AUC) and relative risk calibration. The AUC of models including only SNPs increased with the number of included SNPs and was similar in men and women: the model by Huyghe with 120 SNPs had the highest AUC of 0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.59-0.64] in women and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.66) in men. Adding phenotypic risk factors without age improved discrimination in men but not in women. Adding phenotypic risk factors and age increased discrimination in all cases (P < 0.05), with the best performing models including SNPs, phenotypic risk factors, and age having AUCs between 0.64 and 0.67 in women and 0.67 and 0.71 in men. Relative risk calibration varied substantially across the models. Among middle-aged people in the UK, existing polygenic risk scores discriminate moderately well between those who do and do not develop colorectal cancer over 6 years. Consideration should be given to exploring the feasibility of incorporating genetic and lifestyle/environmental information in any future stratified colorectal cancer screening program."

In the US, the Gail model has been widely used and was used for entry criteria in two large breast cancer prevention trials. We assessed if higher risk levels from the Gail model were associated with less aggressive tumor characteristics and if risk levels were predictive of mortality and survival.
Methods: We used questionnaire data from women in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial to calculate Gail risk levels (low < 1.66%; moderate 1.66-2.99%; high 鈮 3.00%). Women aged 55-74 were enrolled between 1993 and 2001 and had detailed information on breast cancer incidence and tumors collected. We calculated breast cancer incidence and mortality rates among all women by risk levels and examined breast cancer survival and tumor characteristics among women diagnosed with breast cancer. We used Chi-squared tests and multivariable logistic regression to assess the association between risk levels and tumor characteristics.
Results: The study population for this analysis included 45,402 women with 1908 cases of breast cancer. Women at high risk were associated with higher risk of breast cancer mortality compared to women with low risk [rate ratio (RR) = 2.29 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-3.84)]. Higher risk levels were associated with lobular-type tumors [moderate: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.57 95% CI 1.13-2.17; high: aOR = 1.78 95% CI 1.25-2.54] but were not associated with any other tumor characteristics or breast cancer survival.
Conclusions: We did not find evidence that higher risk levels from the Gail model are predictive of less aggressive breast cancer tumors."

Materials and methods: For this retrospective study, 214 women (mean age 卤 standard deviation, 50.5卤10.6 years) with breast cancer were included between April 2016 and April 2018. All patients underwent MRI, including dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI. The morphologic MRI features, the pattern of the time-signal intensity curve (TIC) and the kinetic parameters were obtained for each lesion. The epidemiological and clinical parameters and those imaging parameters were used to construct BN model to estimate TNBC risk. ROC curves upon probability estimates were used to determine the performance of the BN using area under the ROC curves (Az), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.
Results: A BN model consisted of 16 epidemiological and clinical characteristics, morphologic MRI features, and quantitative DCE-MRI parameters were established. The posttest probability table showed that patients with age <35 years, mass-like lesions, type I TIC, and MaxCon 鈮 0.186 were at the highest risk of TNBC. The constructed BN model had an Az of 0.663 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.654, 0.672), sensitivity of 0.660 (95% CI: 0.644, 0.675), specificity of 0.740 (95% CI: 0.726, 0.753) and accuracy of 0.724 (95% CI: 0.714, 0.733) in classifying TNBC.
Conclusion: The BN model integrating epidemiological and clinical characteristics, morphologic and kinetic MRI parameters provide a noninvasive analytical approach for preoperative prediction of the risk of TNBC."

A head and neck cancer risk calculator (HaNC-RC) has previously been designed to aid referral of high-risk patients to USOC clinics (predictive power: 77%). Our aim was to refine the HaNC-RC to increase its prediction potential.
Design: Following sample size calculation, prospective data collection and statistical analysis of referral criteria and outcomes.
Setting: Large tertiary care cancer centre in Scotland.
Participants: 3531 new patients seen in routine, urgent and USOC head and neck (HaN) clinics.
Main outcome measures: Data collected were as follows: demographics, social history, presenting symptoms and signs and HNC diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis were performed to identify significant predictors of HNC. Internal validation was performed using 1000 sample bootstrapping to estimate model diagnostics included the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity.
Results: The updated version of the risk calculator (HaNC-RC v.2) includes age, gender, unintentional weight loss, smoking, alcohol, positive and negative symptoms and signs of HNC. It has achieved an AUC of 88.6% with two recommended triage referral cut-offs to USOC (cut-off: 7.1%; sensitivity: 85%, specificity: 78.3%) or urgent clinics (cut-off: 2.2%; sensitivity: 97.1%; specificity of 52.9%). This could redistribute cancer detection through USOC clinics from the current 60.9%-85.2%, without affecting total numbers seen in each clinical setting.
Conclusions: The use of the HaNC-RC v.2 has a significant potential in both identifying patients at high risk of HNC early thought USOC clinics but also improving health service delivery practices by reducing the number of inappropriately urgent referrals."

Although several useful models for HCC prediction have been previously reported, their usefulness in the Japanese population is unclear. Therefore, this study examines the applicability of these models in Japanese patients.
Methods: Four hundred forty-three patients with no history of HCC who were treated with entecavir, tenofovir alafenamide, or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were enrolled. PAGE-B, modified-PAGE-B, and REACH-B scores were calculated, and subsequent HCC development was investigated.
Results: The mean follow-up duration was 5.1 years, and a total of 33 patients (7.4%) developed HCC during the follow-up period. Multivariate analysis revealed that old age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.09, P = 0.011), male gender (HR 2.62, 95% CI 1.06-6.49, P = 0.037), and low platelet count (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77-0.91, P < 0.001) were independent predictors of HCC development. These factors are the same as the factors identified in the PAGE-B model. Time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve revealed that the AUROCs for 3 and 7 years of PAGE-B (AUROC: 0.786 and 0.744 at 3 and 7 years, respectively) were continuously higher than those of REACH-B (0.658 and 0.543) and modified PAGE-B AUROC (0.772 and 0.731).
Conclusions: PAGE-B, which can easily identify high-risk cases, can be useful for predicting HCC development in Japanese patients treated with NA therapy."

Identifying patients with MH at high risk of harboring bladder cancer can allow for a risk adjusted approach to diagnostic interventions with the goal of safely reducing unnecessary evaluations.
Methods: Patients with a new diagnosis of microhematuria during an 8.5 year period were retrospectively identified. All patients who had a complete MH evaluation were randomized to a training or a validation cohort. Logistic regression analysis was performed in the training cohort to identify factors related to a bladder cancer diagnosis and to develop our model. Receiver operating curves to identify bladder cancer were constructed for the training and validation cohort and tested for their ability to discriminate true cases. A nomogram to predict a bladder cancer diagnosis was created.
Results: In 4,178 patients split into training and validation cohorts, those diagnosed with bladder cancer were shown to be older, have a greater degree of MH (more RBC/hpf), and were former or current smokers. A nomogram created using this model was able to predict risk of a bladder cancer diagnosis with good discrimination (areas under the curve 0.79, 95% CI 0.75-0.83). A cutoff of 0.01 probability demonstrated a sensitivity of 99.1% and a negative predictive value of 99.7%.
Conclusion: A nomogram can accurately predict the risk of bladder cancer diagnosed during the evaluation of MH and can potentially be used avoid a significant number of work ups in those at the lowest risk."

Joint analyses of the two may improve the ability to identify high-risk women.
Methods: This study within the KARMA cohort included prediagnostic measures of plasma hormone levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), its sulfate (DHEAS), and mammographic density in 629 cases and 1,223 controls, not using menopausal hormones. We evaluated the area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) for risk of breast cancer by adding DHEA, DHEAS, and mammographic density to the Gail or Tyrer-Cuzick 5-year risk scores or the CAD2Y 2-year risk score.
Results: DHEAS and percentage density were independently and positively associated with breast cancer risk (P = 0.007 and P < 0.001, respectively) for postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, women. No significant association was seen for DHEA. In postmenopausal women, those in the highest tertiles of both DHEAS and density were at greatest risk of breast cancer (OR, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-6.3) compared with the lowest tertiles. Adding DHEAS significantly improved the AUC for the Gail (+2.1 units, P = 0.008) and Tyrer-Cuzick (+1.3 units, P = 0.007) risk models. Adding DHEAS to the Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick models already including mammographic density further increased the AUC by 1.2 units (P = 0.006) and 0.4 units (P = 0.007), respectively, compared with only including density.
Conclusions: DHEAS and mammographic density are independent risk factors for breast cancer and improve risk discrimination for postmenopausal breast cancer.
Impact: Combining DHEAS and mammographic density could help identify women at high risk who may benefit from individualized breast cancer screening and/or preventive measures among postmenopausal women."

We developed a colorectal cancer risk prediction model incorporating personal, family, genetic, and environmental risk factors to enhance prevention.
Methods: A familial risk profile (FRP) was calculated to summarize individuals' risk based on detailed cancer family history (FH), family structure, probabilities of mutation in major colorectal cancer susceptibility genes, and a polygenic component. We developed risk models, including individuals' FRP or binary colorectal cancer FH, and colorectal cancer risk factors collected at enrollment using population-based colorectal cancer cases (N = 4,445) and controls (N = 3,967) recruited by the Colon Cancer Family Registry Cohort (CCFRC). Model validation used CCFRC follow-up data for population-based (N = 12,052) and clinic-based (N = 5,584) relatives with no cancer history at recruitment to assess model calibration [expected/observed rate ratio (E/O)] and discrimination [area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC)].
Results: The E/O [95% confidence interval (CI)] for FRP models for population-based relatives were 1.04 (0.74-1.45) for men and 0.86 (0.64-1.20) for women, and for clinic-based relatives were 1.15 (0.87-1.58) for men and 1.04 (0.76-1.45) for women. The age-adjusted AUCs (95% CI) for FRP models for population-based relatives were 0.69 (0.60-0.78) for men and 0.70 (0.62-0.77) for women, and for clinic-based relatives were 0.77 (0.69-0.84) for men and 0.68 (0.60-0.76) for women. The incremental values of AUC for FRP over FH models for population-based relatives were 0.08 (0.01-0.15) for men and 0.10 (0.04-0.16) for women, and for clinic-based relatives were 0.11 (0.05-0.17) for men and 0.11 (0.06-0.17) for women.
Conclusions: Both models calibrated well. The FRP-based model provided better risk stratification and risk discrimination than the FH-based model.
